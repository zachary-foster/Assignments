\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Database consolidation and standardization}
In planning a amplicon metabarcoding experiment it is sometimes nessesary to combine multiple refernece database with differnt formats so they can be used in the same pipeline.
This is especially the case when studing multiple kingdoms within a single community or an abscure group of organisms requiring specilized databases. 
Unfortunatly most databases have their own custom FASTA header formats and few have an explicit taxonomy specified, so their taxonomys must be downloaded from NCBI by refernecing an accession or taxonomy ID. 
This means that the first step in any pipline that seeks to use sequences from multiple refenrece databases must be able to read in multiple format.
Therefore, I made a script called \texttt{reformat\_fasta.py} that reformats the FASTA headers of a varity of common refenrece database formats into a format similar to that used by UNITE (Figure \ref{text:database-formats}). 
A single format also makes it easier for multiple scirpts to communicate. 
The header format contians pipe-delimited positional fields for the organism name, genbank ID, refence database-specific ID, and taxonomy. 
The levels of the taxonomy field (Figure \ref{text:taxonomy-string}) are semi-colon-delimited and each is in the form "l\_\_name", where "l" is a one or two character abbreviation of the taxonomic level and "name" is the taxon (e.g. "p\_\_Ascomycota").
Currently the \texttt{reformat\_fasta.py} can read in the formats of the following database: UNITE, ITS1, Genbank, RDP, Phyto ID, and Phyto DB. 
Of these, only Genbank, RDP, and UNITE have full taxonomy information included. 
However the others do have either genbank accession or taxonomy IDs, allowing their full taxonomy to be downloaded. 
A possible future imporvemnt to \texttt{reformat\_fasta.py} could be an ability to automatically download the taxonomoy information for these databases and insert it into their headers.

\subsection*{Initial database statistics}
In order to make downsteam scripts less memory intensive, I made a script called \texttt{fasta\_taxon\_statistics.py} to caluculate taxon-specific statistics before the distance matrix is calculatd.
This is principally done to aid in randomly subsampling the database without loading it all into memory, as is described in the next section. 

Statistics are calculated for each taxon at each taxonomic level. 
Taxa are differntiated by their linage (i.e. the name of the taxon, as well all of the higher level taxa it is a part of). 
Using the lineage to define a taxon instead of just its name and level allows for correct handleing of multiple taxa at the same level with the same name, but part of different higher level taxa (Figure \ref{text:taxonomy-string}).
This is important for correct summary statistics and downstream tree visulaization.
Statistics calculated for each taxon include: the number of sequences, the taxonomic level, the parent taxon, and the child taxa.

\subsection*{Database subsampling}
In order to focus on a specific subset of an entire reference database, I made a python script that subsamples a FASTA reference database, taking into consideration the taxonomy encoded in the headers.
This is often nessesary since refernece databases are very large and the time it takes to calculate a pair-wise distance matrix is proportional to the square of the number of sequences.
Some taxa have much more sequences than are nessary.
On the other hand, many taxa have too few sequences to characterize their sequence variation.
These should be also removed so computational time can be devoted to more informative taxa. 
There also can be inconsienties in the number of taxonomic levels specified, so some filtering is required to remove sequences with low-resuluton taxonomies. 

Therefore, I have made a script called \texttt{fasta\_taxon\_subsample.py} that has the ability to subsample a refenrece database in a taxonomy-specific manner. 
Taxa with too many sequences can be randomly subsampled and taxa with too few can be removed. 
It uses the output of \texttt{fasta\_taxon\_statistics.py} (Figure \ref{text:taxon-statistics-output}) to decide which sequences are to be filtered out before it reads the refenrece database. 
This allows it to reads the database one sequences at a time and thus it is able to process nearly any size of refernece database of data with minimal RAM.
It can also filter out sequences that are not identified to a specific set of taxonomic levels. 
Specific taxa can also be required or removed, so that the user can focus on specific groups of organisms.  

\subsection*{Distance matrix calculation}
One of the most important and computationally intensive steps in this procedure is that calculation of a pairwise distance matrix between all sequences. 
Any program or distance metric can be used; the choice depends of the type of sequence data availble and the characterics of the locus analyzed.
If the refernece datbase is a multiple sequences alignment, then a program such as \texttt{fdnadist} from the EMBOSS package can be used. 
If the sequences are unaligned and all of the same locus, than a pairwise global alignment tool, such as the \texttt{pair.seqs} command from the Mothur package can be used.
