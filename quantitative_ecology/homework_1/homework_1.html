</code></pre>

<p>The effect of the invasive species <em>Alliaria petiolata</em> on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) associations with native plants is evaluated using a variety of greenhouse growth experiments. Soil was collected from areas both colonized an uncolonized by <em>Alliaria petiolata</em> and half of each was sterilized. These 4 soil treatments were used to test:</p>

<ol>
<li>AMF colonization of seedlings of three native tree species.</li>
<li>Biomass increases of seedlings of three native tree species.</li>
<li>Effect of <em>Alliaria petiolata</em> on the previous two experiments</li>
<li>Effect of <em>Alliaria petiolata</em> on AMF spore germination. </li>
</ol>

<h2>2</h2>

<p>In most of the experiments, the experimental units were combinations of a plant and a soil treatments. For experiment 1, there were <code>(3 plants) x (4 soil types) = 12 treatments</code>. For the plant extract experiments, there were <code>(3 plants) x (5 extracts) = 15 treatments</code>. </p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p>In experiment 1, the four treatments were sterilized and unsterilized aliquots of soil colonized and uncolonized by <em>Alliaria petiolata</em>. The other experiments used extracts from <em>Alliaria petiolata</em>, the three native tree species, and water as a control. All experiments tested the growth of the three native tree species. </p>

<p>Since the units should identical besides the treatments applied, no randomization was used to apply treatments to units.</p>

<h2>4</h2>

<p>There was no blinding as far as I can tell. </p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p>For most of the experiments, the responses measured were mychorrizal colonization and increase in plant biomass. One experiment measured AMF spore germination as well. </p>

<h2>6</h2>

<p>Single-factor ANOVA was used for all of the experiments. </p>
