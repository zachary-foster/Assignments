The two land-use types contained communities that were distinct and more than 10\% of the molecular {OTUs} differed in their frequency.},

Until recently, it had not been possible to cost-effectively assess mycorrhizas precisely and accurately. A large-scale survey of {ICP} Forests plots would be only the first stage in answering many of the questions outlined above, but it is essential if future studies are going to address these questions with hypothesis-driven research in a cohesive manner, rather than remain independent for lack of a unified approach. The chance to utilise the vast network of biomonitoring plots at this time is a remarkable opportunity because it minimises the logistics and costs associated with achieving such an enormous effort and provides a rare stable — past and future — ground for forest ecosystem scientific investigation. In the face of rapid global change, we finally have an opportunity to accurately integrate mycorrhizal distribution data with long-term environmental monitoring, providing a basic understanding of functionally crucial organisms, and at the same time creating an invaluable resource for future research.},

In amplicon pyrosequencing studies of fungal diversity, one of the spacers {ITS1} or {ITS2} of the {ITS} region is normally used. In this methodological study we evaluate the usability of {ITS1} vs. {ITS2} as a {DNA} metabarcoding marker for fungi. We analyse three data sets: two comprising {ITS1} and {ITS2} sequences of known taxonomic affiliations and a third comprising {ITS1} and {ITS2} environmental amplicon pyrosequencing data. Clustering analyses of sequences with known taxonomy using the bioinformatics pipeline {ClustEx} revealed that a 97\% similarity cut-off represent a reasonable threshold for estimating the number of known species in the data sets for both {ITS1} and {ITS2.} However, no single threshold value worked well for all fungi at the same time within the curated {UNITE} database, and we found that the Operational Taxonomic Unit ({OTU)} concept is not easily translated into the level of species because many species are distributed over several clusters. Clustering analyses of the 134 692 {ITS1} and {ITS2} pyrosequences using a 97\% similarity cut-off revealed a high similarity between the two data sets when it comes to taxonomic coverage. Although some groups are under- or unrepresented in the two data sets due to, e.g. primer mismatches, our results indicate that {ITS1} and {ITS2} to a large extent yield similar results when used as {DNA} metabarcodes for fungi.},

During a 12-month study, there were 1.8 episodes of A. baumannii bacteremia per 1,000 adults admitted to a hospital in Seville, Spain. Seventy-nine patients were included in the study. A. baumannii bacteremia occurred after a mean (± {SD)} hospitalization of 18 ± 20 days. In all cases the infections were acquired nosocomially; 71\% were acquired in intensive care units. Ampicillinl sulbactam was found to be the most active agent against A. baumannii. The most common source of the bacteremia was the respiratory tract (32 cases [71\%n. Twenty patients (25\%) had septic shock, and 24 (30\%) had disseminated intravascular coagulation ({DIC).} Treatment with imipenem or ampicillinlsulbactam was most effective (cure rates, 87.5\% and 83\%, respectively). The deaths of 27 patients (34\%) were related to A. baumannii bacteremia. The presence of {DIC} (odds ratio [{OR]} = 116.4; P {\textless} .0001) and inappropriate antimicrobial treatment ({OR} = 15.2; P {\textless} .01) were independently associated with mortality.

	abstract = {Sequencing of ribosomal {DNA} clone libraries amplified from environmental {DNA} has revolutionized our understanding of microbial eukaryote diversity and ecology. The results of these analyses have shown that protist groups are far more genetically heterogeneous than their morphological diversity suggests. However, the clone library approach is labour-intensive, relatively expensive, and methodologically biased. Therefore, even the most intensive {rDNA} library analyses have recovered only small samples of much larger assemblages, indicating that global environments harbour a vast array of unexplored biodiversity. High-throughput parallel tag 454 sequencing offers an unprecedented scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Here, we report a 454 protocol for sampling and characterizing assemblages of eukaryote microbes. We use this approach to sequence two {SSU} {rDNA} diversity markers—the variable V4 and V9 regions—from 10 L of anoxic Norwegian fjord water. We identified 38 116 V4 and 15 156 V9 unique sequences. Both markers detect a wide range of taxonomic groups but in both cases the diversity detected was dominated by dinoflagellates and close relatives. Long-tailed rank abundance curves suggest that the 454 sequencing approach provides improved access to rare genotypes. Most tags detected represent genotypes not currently in {GenBank}, although many are similar to database sequences. We suggest that current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, genetic diversity, and global species richness are severely limited by the sequence data hitherto available, and we discuss the biological significance of this high amplicon diversity.},

Polymyxin antibiotics such as colistin have resurfaced as effective last-resort antimicrobials for use against {MDR} Gram-negative pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumannii. Here we show that A. baumannii can rapidly develop resistance to polymyxin antibiotics by complete loss of the initial binding target, the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS)}, which has long been considered to be essential for the viability of Gram-negative bacteria. We characterized 13 independent colistin-resistant derivatives of A. baumannii type strain {ATCC} 19606 and showed that all contained mutations within one of the first three genes of the lipid A biosynthesis pathway: {lpxA}, {lpxC}, and {lpxD.} All of these mutations resulted in the complete loss of {LPS} production. Furthermore, we showed that loss of {LPS} occurs in a colistin-resistant clinical isolate of A. baumannii.

In addition to taxa known to be dominant in soil, including Cercozoa and Ciliophora, we found high relative abundances of groups such as Apicomplexa and Dinophyceae that have not previously been recognized as being important components of soil microbial communities. Soil protistan communities were highly diverse, approaching the extreme diversity of their bacterial counterparts across the same sites. Like bacterial taxa, protistan taxa were not globally distributed, and the composition of these communities diverged considerably across large geographic distances. However, soil protistan and bacterial communities exhibit very different global-scale biogeographical patterns, with protistan communities strongly structured by climatic conditions that regulate annual soil moisture availability.},

	abstract = {Projected temperature increases under global warming could benefit southern tree species by providing them the optimal growing temperature and could be detrimental to northern species by exposing them to the supra optimal growing temperatures. This benefit-detriment trade-off could increase the competitive advantage of southern species in the northern species range and cause the increase or even dominance of southern species in the northern domain. However, the optimum temperature for photosynthesis of C3 plants may increase due to {CO2} enrichment. An increase in the optimum temperature could greatly reduce the benefit-detriment effect. In this study, we coupled a forest ecosystem process model ({PnET-II)} and a forest {GAP} model ({LINKAGES)} with a spatially dynamic forest landscape model ({LANDIS-II)} to study how an optimum temperature increase could affect forest landscape response due to global warming. We simulated 360 years of forest landscape change in the Boundary Water Canoe Area ({BWCA)} in northern Minnesota, which is transitional between boreal and temperate forest. Our results showed that, under the control scenario of continuing the historic 1984–1993 mean climate (mainly temperature, precipitation and {CO2)}, the {BWCA} will become a spruce-fir dominated boreal forest. However, under the scenario of predicted climatic change [the 2000–2099 climates are predicted by Canadian Climate Center ({CCC)}, followed by 200 years of continuing the predicted 2090–2099 mean climate], the {BWCA} will become a pine-dominated mixed forest. If the optimum temperature increases gradually with [{CO2]} (the increase in optimum temperature is assumed to change gradually from 0 {°C} in year 2000 to 5 {°C} in year 2099 when [{CO2]} reaches 711 ppm and stabilizes at 5 {°C} after year 2099), the {BWCA} would remain a fir-dominated boreal forest in areas with relatively high water-holding capacity, but not in areas with relatively low water-holding capacity. Our results suggest that the [{CO2]} induced increases in optimum temperature could substantially reduce forest landscape change caused by global warming. However, not all tree species would be able to successfully adapt to future warming as predicted by {CCC}, regardless of optimum temperature acclimations.},

	abstract = {Tropical coral reefs harbour a reservoir of enormous biodiversity that is increasingly threatened by direct human activities and indirect global climate shifts. Emerging coral diseases are one serious threat implicated in extensive reef deterioration through disruption of the integrity of the coral holobiont – a complex symbiosis between the coral animal, endobiotic alga and an array of microorganisms. In this article, we review our current understanding of the role of microorganisms in coral health and disease, and highlight the pressing interdisciplinary research priorities required to elucidate the mechanisms of disease. We advocate an approach that applies knowledge gained from experiences in human and veterinary medicine, integrated into multidisciplinary studies that investigate the interactions between host, agent and environment of a given coral disease. These approaches include robust and precise disease diagnosis, standardised ecological methods and application of rapidly developing {DNA}, {RNA} and protein technologies, alongside established histological, microbial ecology and ecological expertise. Such approaches will allow a better understanding of the causes of coral mortality and coral reef declines and help assess potential management options to mitigate their effects in the longer term.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a high-throughput method to identify and discriminate the clinically important S. aureus capsular serotypes 5, 8, and {NT} (nontypeable). A comprehensive set of clinical isolates derived from different origins and control strains, representative for each serotype, were used to establish a {CP} typing system based on Fourier transform infrared ({FTIR)} spectroscopy and chemometric techniques. By combining {FTIR} spectroscopy with artificial neuronal network ({ANN)} analysis, a system was successfully established, allowing a rapid identification and discrimination of all three serotypes. The overall accuracy of the {ANN-assisted} {FTIR} spectroscopy {CP} typing system was 96.7\% for the internal validation and 98.2\% for the external validation. One isolate in the internal validation and one isolate in the external validation failed in the classification procedure, but none of the isolates was incorrectly classified. The present study demonstrates that {ANN-assisted} {FTIR} spectroscopy allows a rapid and reliable discrimination of S. aureus capsular serotypes. It is suitable for diagnostic as well as large-scale epidemiologic surveillance of S. aureus capsule expression and provides useful information with respect to chronicity of infection.},

	abstract = {Loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP)} of {DNA} is a simple, cost effective, and rapid method for the specific detection of genomic {DNA} using a set of six oligonucleotide primers with eight binding sites hybridizing specifically to different regions of a target gene, and a thermophilic {DNA} polymerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus for {DNA} amplification. The method has been applied in various assays for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections of humans and animals, sexing of bovine and swine embryos, and in the detection of bacteria from environmental samples. Only recently, first applications for fungal organisms were published. During the current study a {LAMP} assay was developed for the specific detection of Fusarium graminearum, the major causative agent of Fusarium head blight of small cereals and producer of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and zearalenone. The assay was based on the {gaoA} gene (galactose oxidase) of the fungus. Amplification of {DNA} during the reaction was indirectly detected in situ by using calcein fluorescence as a marker without the necessity of time-consuming electrophoretic analysis. The assay was optimized for rapidness, specificity, and sensitivity and was shown to detect the presence of less than 2 pg of purified target {DNA} per reaction within 30 min. Within 132 fungal species tested, exclusively {DNA} isolated from cultures of F. graminearum (lineages 1–9) resulted in a fluorescent signal after amplification with the {LAMP} assay. The method was demonstrated to be useful in the analysis of fungal cultures by direct analysis of surface scrapings from agar plate cultures, direct testing of single infected barley grains, and detection of F. graminearum in total genomic {DNA} isolated from bulk samples of ground wheat grains. Results obtained indicate that {LAMP} offers an interesting new assay format for the rapid and specific {DNA-based} detection and identification of agriculturally important toxigenic fungi in pure cultures and in contaminated sample materials and therefore presents an alternative to {PCR-based} assays.},

	abstract = {Oomycete species occupy many different environments and many ecological niches. The genera Phytophthora and Pythium for example, contain many plant pathogens which cause enormous damage to a wide range of plant species. Proper identification to the species level is a critical first step in any investigation of oomycetes, whether it is research driven or compelled by the need for rapid and accurate diagnostics during a pathogen outbreak. The use of {DNA} for oomycete species identification is well established, but {DNA} barcoding with cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ({COI)} is a relatively new approach that has yet to be assessed over a significant sample of oomycete genera. In this study we have sequenced {COI}, from 1205 isolates representing 23 genera. A comparison to internal transcribed spacer ({ITS)} sequences from the same isolates showed that {COI} identification is a practical option; complementary because it uses the mitochondrial genome instead of nuclear {DNA.} In some cases {COI} was more discriminative than {ITS} at the species level. This is in contrast to the large ribosomal subunit, which showed poor species resolution when sequenced from a subset of the isolates used in this study. The results described in this paper indicate that {COI} sequencing and the dataset generated are a valuable addition to the currently available oomycete taxonomy resources, and that both {COI}, the default {DNA} barcode supported by {GenBank}, and {ITS}, the de facto barcode accepted by the oomycete and mycology community, are acceptable and complementary {DNA} barcodes to be used for identification of oomycetes.},

Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify metabolic and taxonomic shifts in microbial communities associated with the hard coral Acropora millepora throughout a natural thermal bleaching event at Magnetic Island (Great Barrier Reef). A direct comparison of metagenomic data sets from healthy versus bleached corals indicated major shifts in microbial associates during heat stress, including Bacteria, Archaea, viruses, Fungi and micro-algae. Overall, metabolism of the microbial community shifted from autotrophy to heterotrophy, including increases in genes associated with the metabolism of fatty acids, proteins, simple carbohydrates, phosphorus and sulfur. In addition, the proportion of virulence genes was higher in the bleached library, indicating an increase in microorganisms capable of pathogenesis following bleaching. These results demonstrate that thermal stress results in shifts in coral-associated microbial communities that may lead to deteriorating coral health.},

	abstract = {Rock textures commonly preserve a record of the near-surface crystallization history of volcanic rocks. Under conditions of simple cooling without convection or mixing, textures will reflect sample cooling rate, the temperature at which crystallization was initiated, and the distribution of mineral phase precipitation across the crystallization interval. Compilation of plagioclase size and number density data on natural (dike, sill and lava lake) and experimental samples suggests that (1) growth and nucleation rates of plagioclase in natural basaltic samples are a predictable function of cooling rate, and (2) the observed crystallization rate dependence on cooling rate is similar to that observed in experiments initiated at subliquidus temperatures. Comparison of natural and experimental samples thus suggests that most basalts crystallize under conditions of heterogeneous nucleation, with the number density of preexisting nucleii partially controlling textural responses to cooling rate changes. Time scales of crystallization and cooling in magmatic systems are intimately linked through a balance between heat removal from the system and heat evolved through crystallization. Evaluation of textural data in the context of recent numerical models of crystallization in simple (one- and two-component systems) provides new insight into regularities in the crystallization behavior of basaltic magmas. For example, the rate of change in crystal size (and number density, as dictated by mass balance) has been used as a measure of the relative importance of time scales of crystallization and cooling in numerical models of crystallizing systems. In natural samples, plagioclase size scales with the length scale of cooling such that a logarithmic plot of grain size as a function of normalized distance across the dike has a slope that appears approximately independent of dike width (solidification time). Comparison with available textural data for other phenocryst phases suggests that the same may be true for pyroxene and magnetite crystallization, with each phase having a characteristic slope probably controlled by the thermodynamic properties of the crystallizing phase. Measured crystal size distributions are unimodal and show maximum frequencies in the smaller size classes; distributions broaden and the grain size at peak frequency increases with increasing crystallization times (decreasing cooling rates). In contrast, partially crystallized Makaopuhi lava lake samples have crystal size distributions that decrease exponentially with increasing crystal size. Measured size distributions in dikes can be explained by late stage modification of Makaopuhi-type distributions through loss of small crystals, possibly the consequence of growth without nucleation. Finally, this compilation of the textural response of basaltic magmas to changes in cooling rate suggests that empirical calibrations of crystallization rate dependence on cooling rate from natural samples provide a reasonable model for plagioclase crystallization in near-surface basaltic systems. Predicted growth rates will be slow and relatively constant (10 -10 –10 -11 cm/s) for crystallization times expected in most shallow volcanic systems (\&lt;1000 years).},

Using barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing at 13 sites (10 trees/site; 10 leaves/tree), we found very high levels of diversity within sites (a mean of 551 ± 134 taxonomic units per site). However, among-site diversity contributed even more than did within-site diversity to the overall richness of more than 4,200 taxonomic units observed in M. polymorpha, and this among-site variation in endophyte community composition correlated strongly with temperature and rainfall. These results are consistent with suggestions that foliar endophytic fungi are hyperdiverse. They further suggest that microbial diversity may be even greater than has been assumed and that broad-scale environmental controls such as temperature and rainfall can structure eukaryotic microbial diversity. Appropriately constrained study systems across strong environmental gradients present a useful means to understand the environmental factors that structure the diversity of microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases are driving significant changes in global climate. To project potential vegetation response to future climate change, this study uses response surfaces to describe the relationship between bioclimatic variables and the distribution of tree and shrub taxa in western North America. The response surfaces illustrate the probability of the occurrence of a taxon at particular points in climate space. Climate space was defined using three bioclimatic variables: mean temperature of the coldest month, growing degree days, and a moisture index. Species distributions were simulated under present climate using observed data (1951–80, 30-year mean) and under future climate (2090–99, 10-year mean) using scenarios generated by three general circulation {models—HADCM2}, {CGCM1}, and {CSIRO.} The scenarios assume a 1\% per year compound increase in greenhouse gases and changes in sulfate ({SO} 4 ) aerosols based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC)} {IS92a} scenario. The results indicate that under future climate conditions, potential range changes could be large for many tree and shrub taxa. Shifts in the potential ranges of species are simulated to occur not only northward but in all directions, including southward of the existing ranges of certain species. The simulated potential distributions of some species become increasingly fragmented under the future climate scenarios, while the simulated potential distributions of other species expand. The magnitudes of the simulated range changes imply significant impacts to ecosystems and shifts in patterns of species diversity in western North America.},

Two problems are particularly acute in the pursuit of satisfactory taxonomic assignment of newly generated {ITS} sequences: (i) the lack of an inclusive, reliable public reference data set and (ii) the lack of means to refer to fungal species, for which no Latin name is available in a standardized stable way. Here, we report on progress in these regards through further development of the {UNITE} database (http://unite.ut.ee) for molecular identification of fungi. All fungal species represented by at least two {ITS} sequences in the international nucleotide sequence databases are now given a unique, stable name of the accession number type (e.g. Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus{\textbar}{GU586904{\textbar}SH133781.05FU)}, and their taxonomic and ecological annotations were corrected as far as possible through a distributed, third-party annotation effort. We introduce the term ‘species hypothesis’ ({SH)} for the taxa discovered in clustering on different similarity thresholds (97–99\%). An automatically or manually designated sequence is chosen to represent each such {SH.} These reference sequences are released (http://unite.ut.ee/repository.php) for use by the scientific community in, for example, local sequence similarity searches and in the {QIIME} pipeline. The system and the data will be updated automatically as the number of public fungal {ITS} sequences grows. We invite everybody in the position to improve the annotation or metadata associated with their particular fungal lineages of expertise to do so through the new Web-based sequence management system in {UNITE.}},

	abstract = {Forest mortality constitutes a major uncertainty in projections of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and carbon-cycle feedbacks. Recent drought-induced, widespread forest die-offs highlight that climate change could accelerate forest mortality with its diverse and potentially severe consequences for the global carbon cycle, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. How trees die during drought over multiple years remains largely unknown and precludes mechanistic modeling and prediction of forest die-off with climate change. Here, we examine the physiological basis of a recent multiyear widespread die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across much of western North America. Using observations from both native trees while they are dying and a rainfall exclusion experiment on mature trees, we measure hydraulic performance over multiple seasons and years and assess pathways of accumulated hydraulic damage. We test whether accumulated hydraulic damage can predict the probability of tree survival over 2 years. We find that hydraulic damage persisted and increased in dying trees over multiple years and exhibited few signs of repair. This accumulated hydraulic deterioration is largely mediated by increased vulnerability to cavitation, a process known as cavitation fatigue. Furthermore, this hydraulic damage predicts the probability of interyear stem mortality. Contrary to the expectation that surviving trees have weathered severe drought, the hydraulic deterioration demonstrated here reveals that surviving regions of these forests are actually more vulnerable to future droughts due to accumulated xylem damage. As the most widespread tree species in North America, increasing vulnerability to drought in these forests has important ramifications for ecosystem stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem carbon balance. Our results provide a foundation for incorporating accumulated drought impacts into climate-vegetation models. Finally, our findings highlight the critical role of drought stress accumulation and repair of stress-induced damage for avoiding plant mortality, presenting a dynamic and contingent framework for drought impacts on forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {We document high rates of triploidy in aspen (Populus tremuloides) across the western {USA} (up to 69\% of genets), and ask whether the incidence of triploidy across the species range corresponds with latitude, glacial history (as has been documented in other species), climate, or regional variance in clone size. Using a combination of microsatellite genotyping, flow cytometry, and cytology, we demonstrate that triploidy is highest in unglaciated, drought-prone regions of North America, where the largest clone sizes have been reported for this species. While we cannot completely rule out a low incidence of undetected aneuploidy, tetraploidy or duplicated loci, our evidence suggests that these phenomena are unlikely to be significant contributors to our observed patterns. We suggest that the distribution of triploid aspen is due to a positive synergy between triploidy and ecological factors driving clonality. Although triploids are expected to have low fertility, they are hypothesized to be an evolutionary link to sexual tetraploidy. Thus, interactions between clonality and polyploidy may be a broadly important component of geographic speciation patterns in perennial plants. Further, cytotypes are expected to show physiological and structural differences which may influence susceptibility to ecological factors such as drought, and we suggest that cytotype may be a significant and previously overlooked factor in recent patterns of high aspen mortality in the southwestern portion of the species range. Finally, triploidy should be carefully considered as a source of variance in genomic and ecological studies of aspen, particularly in western {U.S.} landscapes.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The massive scale of the 1997–1998 El Niño–associated coral bleaching event underscores the need for strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses resulting from temperature-induced coral mortality. As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify ( 1 ) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality ( i.e., areas of natural “resistance” to bleaching ) and ( 2 ) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred ( i.e., areas of natural community “resilience” ). These “target areas,” where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management.},

We compared the two most frequently used platforms, the Roche 454 {FLX} Titanium and the Illumina Genome Analyzer ({GA)} {II}, on the same {DNA} sample obtained from a complex freshwater planktonic community. Despite the substantial differences in read length and sequencing protocols, the platforms provided a comparable view of the community sampled. For instance, derived assemblies overlapped in ∼90\% of their total sequences and in situ abundances of genes and genotypes (estimated based on sequence coverage) correlated highly between the two platforms (R2{\textgreater}0.9). Evaluation of base-call error, frameshift frequency, and contig length suggested that Illumina offered equivalent, if not better, assemblies than Roche 454. The results from metagenomic samples were further validated against {DNA} samples of eighteen isolate genomes, which showed a range of genome sizes and {G+C\%} content. We also provide quantitative estimates of the errors in gene and contig sequences assembled from datasets characterized by different levels of complexity and {G+C\%} content. For instance, we noted that homopolymer-associated, single-base errors affected ∼1\% of the protein sequences recovered in Illumina contigs of 10× coverage and 50\% {G+C;} this frequency increased to ∼3\% when non-homopolymer errors were also considered. Collectively, our results should serve as a useful practical guide for choosing proper sampling strategies and data possessing protocols for future metagenomic studies.},

	abstract = {We investigated the connection between plant species diversity and climate by using a process-based, generic plant model. Different ‘species' were simulated by different values for certain growth-related model parameters. Subsequently, a wide range of values were tested in the framework of a {‘Monte} Carlo' simulation for success; that is, the capability of each plant with these parameter combinations to reproduce itself during its lifetime. The range of successful parameter combinations approximated species diversity. This method was applied to a global grid, using daily atmospheric forcing from a climate model simulation. The computed distribution of plant ‘species' diversity compares very well with the observed, global-scale distribution of species diversity, reproducing the majority of ‘hot spot' areas of biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted pattern is very robust against changes of fixed model parameters. Analysis of the climatic forcing and of two additional sensitivity simulations demonstrated that the crucial factor leading to this distribution of diversity is the early stage of a plant's life when water availability is highly coupled to the variability in precipitation because in this stage root-zone storage of water is small. We used cluster analysis in order to extract common sets of species parameters, mean plant properties and biogeographic regions (biomes) from the model output. The successful ‘species' cannot be grouped into typical parameter combinations, which define the plant's functioning. However, the mean simulated plant properties, such as lifetime and growth, can be grouped into a few characteristic plant ‘prototypes', ranging from short-lived, fast growing plants, similar to grasses, to long-lived, slow growing plants, similar to trees. The classification of regions with respect to similar combinations of successful ‘species' yields a distribution of biomes similar to the observed distribution. Each biome has typical levels of climatic constraints, expressed for instance by the number of ‘rainy days' and ‘warm days'. The less the number of days favourable for growth, the greater the level of constraints and the less the ‘species' diversity. These results suggest that climate as a fundamental constraint can explain much of the global scale, observed distribution of plant species diversity.},

While these techniques are advantageous, because they do not rely on the need to culture organisms, each technique may have its own biases and/or limitations when used to assess fungal diversity from mixed-template samples. In this study, we analyzed {PCR} specificity and efficiency of the {ITS} primers ({ITS1F} and {ITS4)} in a series of single- and mixed-template samples using a combined quantitative {PCR–length} heterogeneity analysis ({LH-qPCR)} approach. As expected, these primers successfully amplified all higher fungal species tested (10 ascomycetes, 6 basidiomycetes, and 4 zygomycetes) and no members of the oomycetes. Based on our results, and a search of the {GenBank} database, amplicons of the {ITS1F} and {ITS4} primer set exhibit considerable variability (420 to 825 bp), but due to similarities in amplicon sizes of some fungal species, actual species diversity in environmental samples may be underestimated approximately two-fold. The addition of an initial {qPCR} step allowed for the accurate quantitation of total fungal {DNA} in mixed-template samples over five orders of magnitude (10− 1 to 103 pg μl− 1). {PCR} biases between individuals in mixed-templates rendered it impossible to determine the absolute quantity of any individual within a population from its individual peak height. However, relative changes in individuals within a mixed-template sample could be determined due to a constant proportionality between peak heights and starting template concentration. Variability associated with the individual steps of the {LH-qPCR} analysis was also determined from environmental samples.},

	abstract = {Microbes commonly exist in milieus of varying complexity and diversity. Although cultivation-based techniques have been unable to accurately capture the true diversity within microbial communities, these deficiencies have been overcome by applying molecular approaches that target the universally conserved {16S} ribosomal {RNA} gene. The recent application of 454 pyrosequencing to simultaneously sequence thousands of {16S} {rDNA} sequences (pyrotags) has revolutionized the characterization of complex microbial communities. To date, studies based on 454 pyrotags have dominated the field, but sequencing platforms that generate many more sequence reads at much lower costs have been developed. Here, we use the Illumina sequencing platform to design a strategy for {16S} amplicon analysis ({iTags)}, and assess its generality, practicality and potential complications. We fabricated and sequenced paired-end libraries of amplified hyper-variable {16S} {rDNA} fragments from sets of samples that varied in their contents, ranging from a single bacterium to highly complex communities. We adopted an approach that allowed us to evaluate several potential sources of errors, including sequencing artifacts, amplification biases, non-corresponding paired-end reads and mistakes in taxonomic classification. By considering each source of error, we delineate ways to make biologically relevant and robust conclusions from the millions of sequencing reads that can be readily generated by this technology.},

	abstract = {Molecular sequencing has helped resolve the phylogenetic relationships amongst the diverse groups of algal, fungal-like and protist organisms that constitute the Chromalveolate “superkingdom” clade. It is thought that the whole clade evolved from a photosynthetic ancestor and that there have been at least three independent plastid losses during their evolutionary history. The fungal-like oomycetes and hyphochytrids, together with the marine flagellates Pirsonia and Developayella, form part of the clade defined by Cavalier-Smith and Chao (2006) as the phylum {“Pseudofungi”}, which is a sister to the photosynthetic chromistan algae (phylum Ochrophyta). Within the oomycetes, a number of predominantly marine holocarpic genera appear to diverge before the main “saprolegnian” and “peronosporalean” lines, into which all oomycetes had been traditionally placed. It is now clear that oomycetes have their evolutionary roots in the sea. The earliest diverging oomycete genera so far documented, Eurychasma and Haptoglossa, are both obligate parasites that show a high degree of complexity and sophistication in their host parasite interactions and infection structures. Key morphological and cytological features of the oomycetes will be reviewed in the context of our revised understanding of their likely phylogeny. Recent genomic studies have revealed a number of intriguing similarities in host–pathogen interactions between the oomycetes with their distant apicocomplexan cousins. Therefore, the earlier view that oomycetes evolved from the largely saprotrophic “saprolegnian line” is not supported and current evidence shows these organisms evolved from simple holocarpic marine parasites. Both the hyphal-like pattern of growth and the acquisition of oogamous sexual reproduction probably developed largely after the migration of these organisms from the sea to land.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit ({16S)} ribosomal {RNA} gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the ‘rare biosphere’, is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of {16S} {rDNA} amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli {MG1655} as a reference template, we find that {16S} {rDNA} diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of {16S} pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

	abstract = {In aspen and other plant species the effects of environment on phenotype are generally better characterized than genotypic influences. Furthermore, little is known about how genetic influences on tree phenotype change over time. We assessed clonal differences in 417 ramets, representing 18 clones, in a common garden of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) that have developed over 27 years. Genetic contributions to variation in physiology, growth, and vigor were determined over seasonal and multidecadal time scales. The 18 aspen clones exhibited wide-ranging phenotypic variation with two- to threefold differences in physiology and growth traits and more than sevenfold differences in canopy decline and mortality. For growth traits, strong genetic correlations (typically greater than 0.70) and heritability (estimates maintained in a range of 0.25 to 0.36), indicate that genotype had a moderate and consistent influence on growth over the three decades of the study. Physiological traits had much lower genetic correlations and heritability estimates, and they changed significantly within a single growing season. Climatic data suggest that dry conditions in the common garden as the summer progressed may have had a controlling influence on physiological trait responses. Characterizing genetically based phenotypic variation and how it contributes to clone vigor provides a critical link to understanding constraints to aspen viability in its western range.},

We analysed range-wide maternally inherited mitochondrial {DNA} and paternally inherited chloroplast {DNA} sequence data with coalescent simulations and traditional population genetic methods to test hypotheses of population divergence generated from the fossil record of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), an ecologically and economically important western North American conifer. Specifically, we tested (i) the hypothesis that the Pliocene orogeny of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada caused the divergence of coastal and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir varieties; and (ii) the hypothesis that multiple glacial refugia existed on the coast and in the Rocky Mountains. We found that Douglas-fir varieties diverged about 2.11 Ma (4.37 Ma–755 ka), which could be consistent with a Pliocene divergence. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir probably resided in three or more glacial refugia. More variable molecular markers would be required to detect the two coastal refugia suggested in the fossil record. Comparison of mitochondrial {DNA} and chloroplast {DNA} variation revealed that gene flow via pollen linked populations isolated from seed exchange. Postglacial colonization of Canada from coastal and Rocky Mountain refugia near the ice margin at the Last Glacial Maximum produced a wide hybrid zone among varieties that formed almost exclusively by pollen exchange and chloroplast {DNA} introgression, not seed exchange. Postglacial migration rates were 50–165 m/year, insufficient to track projected 21st century warming in some regions. Although fossil and genetic data largely agree, each provides unique insights.},

	abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer ({ITS)} region of nuclear ribosomal {DNA} is a common marker not only for the molecular identification of different taxa and strains, but also for the analysis of population structure of wild microparasite communities. Importantly, the multicopy nature of this region allows the amplification of low-quantity samples of the target {DNA}, a common problem in studies on unicellular, unculturable microparasites. We analysed {ITS} sequences from the protozoan parasite Caullerya mesnili (class Ichthyosporea) infecting waterflea (Daphnia) hosts, across several host population samples. We showed that analysing representative {ITS-types} [as identified by statistical parsimony network analysis ({SPN)]} is a suitable method to address relevant polymorphism. The spatial patterns were consistent regardless of whether parasite {DNA} was extracted from individual hosts or pooled host samples. Remarkably, the efficiency in detecting different sequence types was even higher after sample pooling. As shown by simulations, an easily manageable number of sequences from pooled {DNA} samples are sufficient to resolve the spatial population structure in this system. In summary, the {ITS} region analysed from pooled {DNA} samples can provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of microparasites. Moreover, the application of {SPN} analysis is a good alternative to the well-established neighbour-joining method ({NJ)} for the identification of representative {ITS-types.} {SPN} can even outperform {NJ} by joining most of the singleton sequences to representative sequence clusters.},

Coral disease has been a major contributor to this threat, but little is known about the responsible pathogens. To date most research has focused on bacterial and fungal diseases; however, viruses may also be important for coral health. Using a combination of empirical viral metagenomics and real-time {PCR}, we show that Porites compressa corals contain a suite of eukaryotic viruses, many related to the Herpesviridae. This coral-associated viral consortium was found to shift in response to abiotic stressors. In particular, when exposed to reduced {pH}, elevated nutrients, and thermal stress, the abundance of herpes-like viral sequences rapidly increased in 2 separate experiments. Herpes-like viral sequences were rarely detected in apparently healthy corals, but were abundant in a majority of stressed samples. In addition, surveys of the Nematostella and Hydra genomic projects demonstrate that even distantly related Cnidarians contain numerous herpes-like viral genes, likely as a result of latent or endogenous viral infection. These data support the hypotheses that corals experience viral infections, which are exacerbated by stress, and that herpes-like viruses are common in Cnidarians.},

Existing Illumina sequencing protocols are, however, limited by the fraction of the {16S} {rRNA} gene that is interrogated and therefore limit the resolution and quality of the profiling. To address this, we present the design of a novel protocol for shotgun Illumina sequencing of the bacterial {16S} {rRNA} gene, optimized to amplify more than 90\% of sequences in the Greengenes database and with the ability to distinguish nearly twice as many species-level {OTUs} compared to existing protocols. Using several in silico and experimental datasets, we demonstrate that despite the presence of multiple variable and conserved regions, the resulting shotgun sequences can be used to accurately quantify the constituents of complex microbial communities. The reconstruction of a significant fraction of the {16S} {rRNA} gene also enabled high precision ({\textgreater}90\%) in species-level identification thereby opening up potential application of this approach for clinical microbial characterization.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} Bleaching manifests itself as a loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) and/or chlorophyll from a variety of symbiotic hosts, including corals and sea anemones. Bleaching is known to result from a range of environmental stresses, the most significant of which is elevated temperature; how these stresses elicit a bleaching response is currently the focus of intense research. One consequence of environmental stress that has yet to be considered is viral attack. Here, we have isolated a transferable infectious agent believed to be a virus, from zooxanthellae of the temperate sea anemone Anemonia viridis. The infectious agent is induced by elevated temperature. Once induced, the filterable agent can be further propagated without heat induction, thus fulfilling Koch¹s postulates. We propose that zooxanthellae harbor a latent viral infection that is induced by exposure to elevated temperatures. If such a mechanism also operates in the zooxanthellae harbored by reef corals, and these viruses kill the symbionts, then this could contribute to temperature-induced bleaching.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

	abstract = {Irrigation water recycling is an increasingly important practice in agriculture in the context of diminishing water supply and the regulatory requirements in some parts of the world. This practice potentially accumulates and disseminates plant pathogens including Phytophthora species that pose a great threat to agriculture and forest ecosystems. Despite a high economic importance of Phytophthora species, the current understanding of their aquatic ecology is very limited. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate the distribution and diversity of Phytophthora species in an irrigation reservoir of a commercial nursery in eastern Virginia over two consecutive winters. Multiple baits were deployed in surface water at a run-off entrance, 20, 40, 60 and 80 m from the entrance and near the pump inlet and at various depths at the 20-m station. Ten different Phytophthora species were detected in this study that included P. citrophthora, P. gonapodyides, P. hydropathica, P. inundata, P. irrigata, P. megasperma, P. pini, P. polonica, P. syringae and P. tropicalis. Phytophthora recovery declined through the winters from November to March. It also declined with distance from the run-off entrance. These results suggest that water decontamination during winter irrigation events is required at this nursery and possibly in the nurseries from the southern part of the United States. The placement of the pump inlet away from run-off entrance may be a viable strategy to reduce the crop health risk.},

	abstract = {The root-rhizosphere interface of Populus is the nexus of a variety of associations between bacteria, fungi, and the host plant and an ideal model for studying interactions between plants and microorganisms. However, such studies have generally been confined to greenhouse and plantation systems. Here we analyze microbial communities from the root endophytic and rhizospheric habitats of Populus deltoides in mature natural trees from both upland and bottomland sites in central Tennessee. Community profiling utilized 454 pyrosequencing with separate primers targeting the V4 region for bacterial {16S} {rRNA} and the {D1/D2} region for fungal {28S} {rRNA} genes. Rhizosphere bacteria were dominated by Acidobacteria (31\%) and Alphaproteobacteria (30\%), whereas most endophytes were from the Gammaproteobacteria (54\%) as well as Alphaproteobacteria (23\%). A single Pseudomonas-like operational taxonomic unit ({OTU)} accounted for 34\% of endophytic bacterial sequences. Endophytic bacterial richness was also highly variable and 10-fold lower than in rhizosphere samples originating from the same roots. Fungal rhizosphere and endophyte samples had approximately equal amounts of the Pezizomycotina (40\%), while the Agaricomycotina were more abundant in the rhizosphere (34\%) than endosphere (17\%). Both fungal and bacterial rhizosphere samples were highly clustered compared to the more variable endophyte samples in a {UniFrac} principal coordinates analysis, regardless of upland or bottomland site origin. Hierarchical clustering of {OTU} relative abundance patterns also showed that the most abundant bacterial and fungal {OTUs} tended to be dominant in either the endophyte or rhizosphere samples but not both. Together, these findings demonstrate that root endophytic communities are distinct assemblages rather than opportunistic subsets of the rhizosphere.},

	doi = {10.1006/jmbi.1999.3013},
	abstract = {The 70 {kDa} soluble lytic transglycosylase (Slt70) from Escherichia coli is an exo-muramidase, that catalyses the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds between N -acetylmuramic acid and N -acetylglucosamine residues in peptidoglycan, the main structural component of the bacterial cell wall. This cleavage is accompanied by the formation of a 1,6-anhydro bond between the C1 and O6 atoms in the N -acetylmuramic acid residue ({anhMurNAc).} Crystallographic studies at medium resolution revealed that Slt70 is a multi-domain protein consisting of a large ring-shaped alpha-superhelix with on top a catalytic domain, which resembles the fold of goose-type lysozyme. Here we report the crystal structures of native Slt70 and of its complex with a 1,6-anhydromuropeptide solved at nominal resolutions of 1.65 A and 1.90 A, respectively. The high resolution native structure reveals the details on the hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that stabilise the catalytic domain and the alpha-superhelix. The building-block of the alpha-superhelix is an "up-down-up-down" four-alpha-helix bundle involving both parallel and antiparallel helix pairs. Stabilisation of the fold is provided through an extensive packing of apolar atoms, mostly from leucine and alanine residues. It lacks, however, an internal consensus sequence that characterises other super-secondary helical folds like the beta-helix in pectate lyase or the (beta-alpha)-helix in the ribonuclease inhibitor. The 1, 6-anhydromuropeptide product binds in a shallow groove adjacent to the peptidoglycan-binding groove of the catalytic domain. The groove is formed by conserved residues at the interface of the catalytic domain and the alpha-superhelix. The structure of the Slt70-1, 6-anhydromuropeptide complex confirms the presence of a specific binding-site for the peptide moieties of the peptidoglycan and it substantiates the notion that Slt70 starts the cleavage reaction at the {anhMurNAc} end of the peptidoglycan.},

Rhododendron production in the United States. These Rhododendron spp. are known to
be infected with fungal endophytes. However, the community structure of these
endophytes in native and cultivated Rhododendron is poorly understood. Our study
targeted the foliar fungal endophyte communities of two native Rhododendron spp. and
two non-native commercially cultivated Rhododendron varieties. Parallel culturedependent
(fungal isolation and identification based on {ITS} sequencing) and cultureindependent
sequencing approaches (metagenomic sequencing of the {ITS} region using
454 pyrosequencing) were employed, and results provided evidence of distinctly different
community structure in each host species. Additionally, results indicated higher diversity
among cultivated and nursery grown Rhododendron. This suggests that the close
proximity of the nurseries sampled to the forest environment allows exposure to two
distinct sources of endophyte infection. Together, our results show the importance of host
identity and environment in structuring the associated endophyte communities.},

We report molecular epidemiology of 65 carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates identified from hospitals in New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Missouri, Nevada, and California between 2008 and 2009. All isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ({PFGE).} Select isolates then underwent multilocus sequence typing ({MLST).} While the {PFGE} patterns tended to cluster within each hospital, sequence types ({STs)} belonging to the clonal complex 92 ({CC92)} and the pan-European clonal lineage {II} ({EUII;} worldwide clonal lineage 2) were predominant in all hospitals. Of them, {ST122} and {ST208} were the most common and were found in four of the six hospitals. Isolates belonging to the pan-European clonal lineages I and {III} were identified in one hospital each. Carbapenemase-encoding genes {blaOXA-23} and/or {ISAba1-blaOXA-51-like} were present among the majority of isolates. These findings suggest that carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates found in {U.S.} hospitals constitute part of the global epidemic driven by {CC92}, but have unique {STs} other than {ST92}, which may be spreading by means of patient transfer between health care facilities within the United States.},

Plant pathogenic oomycetes, including Phytophthora, Pythium and downy mildew species, cause devastating diseases on a wide range of host species and have a significant impact on agriculture. Here, we report comparative analyses on the genomes of thirteen straminipilous species, including eleven plant pathogenic oomycetes, to explore common features linked to their pathogenic lifestyle. We report the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of six Pythium genomes and comparison with other stramenopiles including photosynthetic diatoms, and other plant pathogenic oomycetes such as Phytophthora species, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and Pythium ultimum var. ultimum. Novel features of the oomycete genomes include an expansion of genes encoding secreted effectors and plant cell wall degrading enzymes in Phytophthora species and an over-representation of genes involved in proteolytic degradation and signal transduction in Pythium species. A complete lack of classical {RxLR} effectors was observed in the seven surveyed Pythium genomes along with an overall reduction of pathogenesis-related gene families in H. arabidopsidis. Comparative analyses revealed fewer genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in Pythium species and H. arabidopsidis as compared to Phytophthora species, suggesting variation in virulence mechanisms within plant pathogenic oomycete species. Shared features between the oomycetes and diatoms revealed common mechanisms of intracellular signaling and transportation. Our analyses demonstrate the value of comparative genome analyses for exploring the evolution of pathogenesis and survival mechanisms in the oomycetes. The comparative analyses of seven Pythium species with the closely related oomycetes, Phytophthora species and H. arabidopsidis, and distantly related diatoms provide insight into genes that underlie virulence.},

	abstract = {Many studies have been conducted to quantify the possible ecosystem/landscape response to the anticipated global warming. However, there is a large amount of uncertainty in the future climate predictions used for these studies. Specifically, the climate predictions can be very different based on a variety of global climate models and alternative greenhouse emission scenarios. In this study, we coupled a forest landscape model, {LANDIS-II}, and a forest process model, {PnET-II}, to examine the uncertainty (that results from the uncertainty in the future climate predictions) in the forest-type composition prediction for a transitional forest landscape [the Boundary Water Canoe Area]. Using an improved global-sensitivity analysis technique [Fourier amplitude sensitivity test], we also quantified the amount of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction contributed by different climate variables including temperature, {CO2}, precipitation and photosynthetic active radiation ({PAR).} The forest landscape response was simulated for the period 2000–2400 ad based on the differential responses of 13 tree species under an ensemble of 27 possible climate prediction profiles (monthly time series of climate variables). Our simulations indicate that the uncertainty in the forest-type composition becomes very high after 2200 ad, which is close to the time when the current forests are largely removed by windthrow disturbances and natural mortality. The most important source of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction is from the uncertainty in temperature predictions. The second most important source is {PAR}, the third is {CO2} and the least important is precipitation. Our results also show that if the optimum photosynthetic temperature rises due to {CO2} enrichment, the forest landscape response to climatic change measured by forest-type composition may be substantially reduced.},

Albugo was intermediate between these two groups. Unlike Pythium, Phytophthora was essentially monophyletic, all but three species forming a cluster of eight clades. Two clades contained only species with nonpapillate sporangia. The other six clades included either papillate and semipapillate, or semipapillate and nonpapillate types, transcending traditional morphological groupings, which are evidently not natural assemblages. Peronospora was related to P. megakarya and P. palmivora and appears to be derived from a Phytophthora that has both lost the ability to produce zoospores and become an obligate biotroph. Three other Phytophthoras located some distance from the main {Phytophthora–Peronospora} cluster probably represent one or more additional genera.},

	doi = {10.3852/10-331},
	abstract = {Regions of {rDNA} are commonly used to infer phylogenetic relationships among fungal species and as {DNA} barcodes for identification. These regions occur in large tandem arrays, and concerted evolution is believed to reduce intragenomic variation among copies within these arrays, although some variation still might exist. Phylogenetic studies typically use consensus sequencing, which effectively conceals most intragenomic variation, but cloned sequences containing intragenomic variation are becoming prevalent in {DNA} databases. To understand effects of using cloned {rDNA} sequences in phylogenetic analyses we amplified and cloned the {ITS} region from pure cultures of six Laetiporus species and one Wolfiporia species (Basidiomycota, Polyporales). An average of 66 clones were selected randomly and sequenced from 21 cultures, producing a total of 1399 interpretable sequences. Significant variation (≥ 5\% variation in sequence similarity) was observed among {ITS} copies within six cultures from three species clades (L. cincinnatus, L. sp. clade J, and Wolfiporia dilatohypha) and phylogenetic analyses with the cloned sequences produced different trees relative to analyses with consensus sequences. Cloned sequences from L. cincinnatus fell into more than one species clade and numerous cloned L. cincinnatus sequences fell into entirely new clades, which if analyzed on their own most likely would be recognized as "undescribed" or "novel" taxa. The use of a 95\% cut off for defining operational taxonomic units ({OTUs)} produced seven Laetiporus {OTUs} with consensus {ITS} sequences and 20 {OTUs} with cloned {ITS} sequences. The use of cloned {rDNA} sequences might be problematic in fungal phylogenetic analyses, as well as in fungal bar-coding initiatives and efforts to detect fungal pathogens in environmental samples.},

This method employs a {DNA} polymerase and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target {DNA.} An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the target {DNA} initiates {LAMP.} The following strand displacement {DNA} synthesis primed by an outer primer releases a single-stranded {DNA.} This serves as template for {DNA} synthesis primed by the second inner and outer primers that hybridize to the other end of the target, which produces a stem–loop {DNA} structure. In subsequent {LAMP} cycling one inner primer hybridizes to the loop on the product and initiates displacement {DNA} synthesis, yielding the original stem–loop {DNA} and a new stem–loop {DNA} with a stem twice as long. The cycling reaction continues with accumulation of 109 copies of target in less than an hour. The final products are stem–loop {DNAs} with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target in the same strand. Because {LAMP} recognizes the target by six distinct sequences initially and by four distinct sequences afterwards, it is expected to amplify the target sequence with high selectivity.},

	abstract = {The use of next-generation {DNA} sequencing methods, which produce massive volumes of data, has transformed fungal molecular ecology. These technologies offer the opportunity to describe microbial communities in depth and to investigate fungal diversity at a large geographical scale. In particular, due to the emergence of studies conducted at a large scale (countries, continents), the definition of a compromise between the optimal and representative description of local diversity (plot scale) and the management of a greater number of sites for these studies is required. This work was performed to explore the local richness and the structure of the ectomycorrhizal ({EcM)} fungal and oomycete communities in a temperate beech plot using 454 pyrosequencing technology. The internal transcribed spacer 1 ({ITS1)} region was amplified and sequenced from fine roots and soil sampled from the two upper horizons. Our analyses suggest that soil could be a good substitute for fine roots in studying {EcM} fungi. The fungal assemblage exhibited a vertical distribution in the soil profile. Only four Pythiaceae were identified, which was insufficient to study the spatial distribution of this group. The fungal and particularly the ectomycorrhizal ({EcM)} richness was not correlated with any soil variable ({pH}, C, N or P), but the spatial structure was explained by the {C:N} ratio and phosphorus content. Our data reveal the importance of maintaining a minimal representative sampling at the plot scale for comparative geographical studies.},

	abstract = {{SNPs} discovered by genome-wide association studies ({GWASs)} account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 {SNPs} genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all {SNPs} simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped {SNPs}, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the {SNPs} explored to date.

	abstract = {Six {DNA} regions were evaluated as potential {DNA} barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal {RNA} cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II}, second largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II}, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low {PCR} amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer ({ITS)} region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the {ITS.} The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. {ITS} will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relevés obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the “sampled patch size,” i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species–site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

All the 40 presently available ex-type strains were included in this study, as well as 20 sequences of recently described species from {GenBank.} Species for which no ex-type strains were available were represented by either authentic strains (6), strains used in the 1981 monograph of the genus by van der Plaats-Niterink (33), or strains selected on morphological criteria (17). Parsimony analysis generated two major clades representing the Pythium species with filamentous or globose sporangia. A small clade of species with contiguous sporangia was found in between the two main clades. A total number of 11 smaller clades was recognized, which often correlated with host-type or substrate and in several cases with a subset of morphological characters. Many characters used in species descriptions, such as antheridium position, did not correlate with phylogeny. A comparison of the ex-type and representative strains with all {ITS} sequences of Pythium in {GenBank} revealed limited infraspecific variation with the exception of P. rostratum, P. irregulare, P. heterothallicum, and P. ultimum. The total number of species examined was 116 (including 60 ex-type strains). Twenty-six species had {ITS} sequences identical or nearly identical to formerly described species, suggesting possible conspecificity.

This organism has emerged recently as a major cause of {HAI} because of the extent of its antimicrobial resistance and its propensity to cause large, often multifacility, nosocomial outbreaks. The occurrence of outbreak is facilitated by both tolerance to desiccation and multidrug resistance, contributing to the maintenance of these organisms in the hospital environment. In addition, the epidemiology of A. baumannii infection is often complex, with the coexistence of epidemic and endemic infections, the latter of which often is favored by the selection pressure of antimicrobials. The only good news is that potentially severe A. baumannii infection, such as bacteremia or pneumonia in patients in the intensive care unit who are undergoing intubation, do not seem to be associated with a higher attributable mortality rate or an increased length of hospital stay.},

Many nucleoporins contain {FG} sequence repeats, and previous studies have demonstrated interactions between repeats containing {FxFG} or {GLFG} cores and transport factors. The crystal structure of residues 1-442 of importin-beta bound to a {GLFG} peptide indicates that this repeat core binds to the same primary site as {FxFG} cores. Importin-beta-{I178D} shows reduced binding to both {FxFG} and {GLFG} repeats, consistent with both binding to an overlapping site in the hydrophobic groove between the A-helices of {HEAT} repeats 5 and 6. Moreover, {FxFG} repeats can displace importin-beta or its S. cerevisiae homologue, Kap95, bound to {GLFG} repeats. Addition of soluble {GLFG} repeats decreases the rate of nuclear protein import in digitonin-permeabilized {HeLa} cells, indicating that this interaction has a role in the translocation of carrier-cargo complexes through nuclear pores. The binding of {GLFG} and {FxFG} repeats to overlapping sites on importin-beta indicates that functional differences between different repeats probably arise from differences in their spatial organization.},

	abstract = {Owing to previous methodological limitations, knowledge about the fine-scale distribution of fungal mycelia in decaying logs is limited. We investigated fungal communities in decaying Norway spruce logs at various spatial scales at two environmentally different locations in Sweden. On the basis of 454 pyrosequencing of the {ITS2} region of {rDNA}, 1914 operational taxonomic units ({OTUs)} were detected in 353 samples. The communities differed significantly among logs, but the physical distance between logs was not found to have a significant effect on whether fungal communities had any resemblance to each other. Within a log, samples that were closer together generally had communities that showed more resemblance to each other than those that were further apart. {OTUs} characteristic for particular positions on the logs could be identified. In general, these {OTUs} did not overlap with the most abundant {OTUs}, and their ecological role was often unknown. Only a few {OTUs} were detected in the majority of logs, whereas numerous {OTUs} were rare and present in only one or a few logs. Wood-decaying Basidiomycetes were often represented by higher sequence reads in individual logs than Ascomycete {OTUs}, suggesting that Basidiomycete mycelia spread out more rapidly when established. {OTU} richness tended to increase with the decay stage of the sample; however, the known wood decayers were most abundant in less-decomposed samples. The fungi identified in the logs represented different ecological strategies. Our findings differ from previously published sporocarp studies, indicating that the highly abundant fruiting species may respond to environment in different ways than the rest of the fungal community.},

Increasing antimicrobial resistance among Acinetobacter isolates has been documented, although definitions of multidrug resistance vary in the literature. A. baumannii survives for prolonged periods under a wide range of environmental conditions. The organism causes outbreaks of infection and health care–associated infections, including bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infection, and wound infection. Antimicrobial resistance greatly limits the therapeutic options for patients who are infected with this organism, especially if isolates are resistant to the carbapenem class of antimicrobial agents. Because therapeutic options are limited for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection, the development or discovery of new therapies, well-controlled clinical trials of existing antimicrobial regimens and combinations, and greater emphasis on the prevention of health care–associated transmission of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection are essential.},

Such an energy imbalance is sensed through alterations in photosystem {II} excitation pressure, which reflects the relative reduction state of the photosystem. Modulation of this novel, chloroplastic redox signal either by excess light or by low temperature initiates a signal transduction pathway. This appears to coordinate photosynthesis-related gene expression and to influence the nuclear expression of a specific cold-acclimation gene, plant morphology and differentiation in cyanobacteria. Thus, in addition to its traditional role in energy transduction, the photosynthetic apparatus might also be an environmental sensor.},

	abstract = {Elevated temperatures and solar ultraviolet ({UV)} radiation have been implicated as recent causes for the loss of symbiotic algae (i.e., bleaching) in corals and other invertebrates with photoautotrophic symbionts. One hypothesized mechanism of coral bleaching involves the production of reduced oxygen intermediates, or toxic oxygen, in the dinoflagellate symbionts and host tissues that subsequently causes cellular damage and expulsion of symbionts. Measurements of photosynthesis in the Caribbean coral Agaricia tenuifolia, taken during temperature-induced stress and exposure to full solar radiation, showed a decrease in photosynthetic performance followed by bleaching. Exposure of corals to exogenous antioxidants that scavenge reactive oxygen species during temperature-induced stress improves maximum photosynthetic capacity to rates indistinguishable from corals measured at the ambient temperature of their site of collection. Additionally, these antioxidants prevent the coral from “ bleaching ” and affect the mechanism of symbiont loss from the coral host. These observations confirm a role for oxidative stress, whether caused by elevated temperatures or exposure to {UV} radiation, in the bleaching phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Genotyping methods are essential to understand the transmission dynamics of Acinetobacter baumannii. We examined the representative genotypes of A. baumannii at different time periods in select locations in Ohio, using two rapid automated typing methods: {PCR} coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ({PCR/ESI-MS)}, a form of multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST)}, and repetitive-sequence-based-{PCR} (rep-{PCR).} Our analysis included 122 isolates from 4 referral hospital systems, in 2 urban areas of Ohio. These isolates were associated with outbreaks at 3 different time periods (1996, 2000 and 2005–2007). Type assignments of {PCR/ESI-MS} and rep-{PCR} were compared to each other and to worldwide ({WW)} clone types. The discriminatory power of each method was determined using the Simpson's index of diversity ({DI).} We observed that {PCR/ESI-MS} sequence type ({ST)} 14, corresponding to {WW} clone 3, predominated in 1996, whereas {ST} 12 and 14 co-existed in the intermediate period (2000) and {ST} 10 and 12, belonging to {WW} clone 2, predominated more recently in 2007. The shift from {WW} clone 3 to {WW} clone 2 was accompanied by an increase in carbapenem resistance. The {DI} was approximately 0.74 for {PCR/ESI-MS}, 0.88 for rep-{PCR} and 0.90 for the combination of both typing methods. We conclude that combining rapid automated typing methods such as {PCR/ESI-MS} and rep-{PCR} serves to optimally characterize the regional molecular epidemiology of A. baumannii. Our data also sheds light on the changing sequence types in an 11 year period in Northeast Ohio.},

Sudden oak death, caused by the fungus-like pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, has caused devastating levels of mortality of live oak and tanoak trees in coastal California forests and in urban and suburban landscapes in the San Francisco Bay Area. This pathogen also causes non-lethal disease on popular ornamental plants, including rhododendrons, viburnums, and camellias. P. ramorum was discovered in California in the late 1990s and is exotic to the United States. Recently, presence of the disease in wholesale nurseries in California, Oregon, and Washington has led to shipments of diseased plants across the {US}, thus risking the introduction of the pathogen to other vulnerable forests. We examined the genetic diversity of this pathogen in {US} nurseries in order to better understand its evolution in nurseries and movement between states. We found that California populations were genetically different enough from Oregon and Washington populations that infestations of the pathogen found in nurseries in other states could be distinguished as having originated from California or the Northwest. Our inferences were consistent with trace forward investigations by regulatory agencies.},

B-{ARISA} profiles revealed a significant difference in the endophytic community between cultivars ({perMANOVA}, p {\textless} 0.001), and canonical correspondence analysis showed a significant correlation between the community structure and plant biomass (p = 0.001). Pyrosequencing detected, on average, 477 ± 71 bacterial operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}, 97\% genetic similarity) residing within the roots of each cultivar, with a Chao estimated total {OTU} richness of 1,265 ± 313. Across all cultivars, a total of 238 known genera from 15 phyla were identified. Interestingly, five of the ten most common genera (Rheinheimera, Dyadobacter, Devosia, Pedobacter, and Pseudoxanthomonas) have not, to our knowledge, been previously reported as endophytes of potato. Like the B-{ARISA} analysis, the endophytic communities differed between cultivar/clones (∫-libshuff, p {\textless} 0.001) and exhibited low similarities on both a presence/absence (0.145 ± 0.019) and abundance (0.420 ± 0.081) basis. Seventeen {OTUs} showed a strong positive (r {\textgreater} 0.600) or negative (r {\textless} −0.600) correlation with plant biomass, suggesting a possible link between plant production and endophyte abundance. This study represents one of the most comprehensive assessments of the bacterial endophytic communities to date, and similar analyses in other plant species, cultivars, or tissues could be utilized to further elucidate the potential contribution(s) of endophytic communities to plant physiology and production.},

In order to understand the repertoire of resistance determinants and their organization and origins, we compared the genome sequences of three {MDR} and three drug-susceptible A. baumannii isolates. The entire {MDR} phenotype can be explained by the acquisition of discrete resistance determinants distributed throughout the genome. A comparison of closely related {MDR} and drug-susceptible isolates suggests that drug efflux may be a less significant contributor to resistance to certain classes of antibiotics than inactivation enzymes are. A resistance island with a variable composition of resistance determinants interspersed with transposons, integrons, and other mobile genetic elements is a significant but not universal contributor to the {MDR} phenotype. Four hundred seventy-five genes are shared among all six clinical isolates but absent from the related environmental species Acinetobacter baylyi {ADP1.} These genes are enriched for transcription factors and transporters and suggest physiological features of A. baumannii that are related to adaptation for growth in association with humans.},

	abstract = {Viruses are ubiquitous and abundant pathogens that likely infect and disrupt all cellular organisms. Although a high diversity of viral types has been characterized from corals over the last decade, we are only beginning to understand the distribution, dynamics, and roles of viral consortia in reef ecosystems. This review synthesizes previous work on the viruses associated with corals and their cnidarian relatives, and highlights some strengths and limitations of the methods commonly used for viral analysis. Based on these foundational studies, we present a current working model for stony coral virology. We hypothesize that viruses are present on and within corals and that these consortia commonly include representatives of the Herpesviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and phages and archaeal viruses. Our working model posits that these different viral groups target distinct hosts, specifically the coral itself, its endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.), and its resident microbiome, respectively. Corals may also harbor additional viral diversity (e.g., members of the Iridoviridae) that is pathogenic to reef-associated organisms. Viral infections likely underlie some coral diseases and may be responsible for reef epizootics, but evidence for viral-mediated coral disease is currently inconclusive. Future efforts in coral viral ecology should focus on determining if and how viral infection contributes to reduced coral fitness and/or benthic community shifts in reef ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Glacial Lake Missoula formed when the Purcell Trench lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet dammed Clark Fork River in Montana during the Fraser Glaciation (marine oxygen isotope stage 2). Over a period of several thousand years, the lake repeatedly filled and drained through its ice dam, and floodwaters coursed across the landscape in eastern Washington. In this paper, we describe the stratigraphy and sedimentology of a significant new section of fine-grained glacial Lake Missoula sediment and compare this section to a similar, previously described sequence of sediments at Ninemile Creek, 26 km to the northwest. The new exposure, which we informally term the rail line section, is located near Missoula, Montana, and exposes 29 units, each of which consists of many silt and clay couplets that we interpret to be varves. The deposits are similar to other fine-grained sediments attributed to glacial Lake Missoula. Similar varved sediments overlie gravelly flood deposits elsewhere in the glacial Lake Missoula basin. Each of the 29 units represents a period when the lake was deepening, and all units show evidence for substantial draining of glacial Lake Missoula that repeatedly exposed the lake floor. The evidence includes erosion and deformation of glaciolacustrine sediment that we interpret happened during draining of the lake, desiccation cracks that formed during exposure of the lake bottom, and fluvial sand deposited as the lake began to refill.

The floods date to between approximately 21.4 and 13.4 cal ka ago based on regional chronological data. The total number of varves at the rail line and Ninemile sites are, respectively, 732 and 583. Depending on lake refilling times, each exposure probably records 1350–1500 years of time. We present three new optical ages from the rail line and Ninemile sites that further limit the age of the floods. These ages, in calendar years, are 15.1 ± 0.6 ka at the base of the Ninemile exposure, and 14.8 ± 0.7 and 12.6 ± 0.6 ka midway through the rail line exposure. The sediment at the two sections was deposited during later stages of glacial Lake Missoula, after the largest outburst events.},

	abstract = {Changes in the distribution of sub-alpine tree species in western North America have been attributed to climatic change and other environmental stresses. These changes include tree-line fluctuations throughout the Holocene and recent invasion of sub-alpine meadows by forest. Most palaeoecological studies suggest that the tree-line was higher during a period of warmer climate approximately 9000 to 5000 {BP} and lower during the last 5000 years, with short periods of local tree-line advance. Recent advances in sub-alpine tree distribution can be compared with weather records, allowing an examination of relationships between tree advance and climate at a finer resolution. In general, recent sub-alpine forest advances in western North America, based on studies representing three climatic zones (maritime, Mediterranean and continental), have been associated with climatic periods favouring tree germination and growth, although factors such as fire and grazing by domestic livestock have had an impact in some areas. Limitations to tree establishment (e.g., winter snow accumulation, summer drought) vary in relative importance within each climate zone, as do predicted consequences of anthropogenic climatic change. Recent increases in establishment of sub-alpine trees may continue if climatic change alleviates the limitations to tree establishment important in each climatic zone. However, factors such as topography and disturbance may modify tree establishment on a local scale.},

Analysis of the assembled genome revealed a whole-genome duplication event; about 8000 pairs of duplicated genes from that event survived in the Populus genome. A second, older duplication event is indistinguishably coincident with the divergence of the Populus and Arabidopsis lineages. Nucleotide substitution, tandem gene duplication, and gross chromosomal rearrangement appear to proceed substantially more slowly in Populus than in Arabidopsis. Populus has more protein-coding genes than Arabidopsis, ranging on average from 1.4 to 1.6 putative Populus homologs for each Arabidopsis gene. However, the relative frequency of protein domains in the two genomes is similar. Overrepresented exceptions in Populus include genes associated with lignocellulosic wall biosynthesis, meristem development, disease resistance, and metabolite transport.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, culture-independent surveys of marine picoeukaryotic diversity based on {18S} ribosomal {DNA} clone libraries have unveiled numerous sequences of novel high-rank taxa. This newfound diversity has significantly altered our understanding of marine microbial food webs and the evolution of eukaryotes. However, the current picture of marine eukaryotic biodiversity may be significantly skewed by {PCR} amplification biases, occurrence of {rDNA} genes in multiple copies within a single cell, and the capacity of {DNA} to persist as extracellular material. In this study we performed an analysis of the metagenomic dataset from the Global Ocean Survey ({GOS)} expedition, seeking eukaryotic ribosomal signatures. This {PCR-free} approach revealed similar phylogenetic patterns to clone library surveys, suggesting that {PCR} steps do not impose major biases in the exploration of environmental {DNA.} The different cell size fractions within the {GOS} dataset, however, displayed a distinct picture. High protistan diversity in the {\textless}0.8 µm size fraction, in particular sequences from radiolarians and ciliates (and their absence in the 0.8–3 µm fraction), suggest that most of the {DNA} in this fraction comes from extracellular material from larger cells. In addition, we compared the phylogenetic patterns from {rDNA} and reverse transcribed {rRNA} {18S} clone libraries from the same sample harvested in the Mediterranean Sea. The libraries revealed major differences, with taxa such as pelagophytes or picobiliphytes only detected in the {18S} {rRNA} library. {MAST} (Marine Stramenopiles) appeared as potentially prominent grazers and we observed a significant decrease in the contribution of alveolate and radiolarian sequences, which overwhelmingly dominated {rDNA} libraries. The {rRNA} approach appears to be less affected by taxon-specific {rDNA} copy number and likely better depicts the biogeochemical significance of marine protists.},

	abstract = {The coral holobiont is a dynamic assemblage of the coral animal, zooxanthellae, endolithic algae and fungi, {Bacteria,Archaea} and viruses. Zooxanthellae and some Bacteria form relatively stable and species-specific associations with corals. Other associations are less specific; coral-associated Archaea differ from those in the water column, but the same archaeal species may be found on different coral species. It has been hypothesized that the coral animal can adapt to differing ecological niches by ‘switching’ its microbial associates. In the case of corals and zooxanthellae, this has been termed adaptive bleaching and it has important implications for carbon cycling within the coral holobiont and ultimately the survival of coral reefs. However, the roles of other components of the coral holobiont are essentially unknown. To better understand these other coral associates, a fractionation procedure was used to separate the microbes, mitochondria and viruses from the coral animal cells and zooxanthellae. The resulting metagenomic {DNA} was sequenced using pyrosequencing. Fungi, Bacteria and phage were the most commonly identified organisms in the metagenome. Three of the four fungal phyla were represented, including a wide diversity of fungal genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that the endolithic community is more important than previously appreciated. In particular, the data suggested that endolithic fungi could be converting nitrate and nitrite to ammonia, which would enable fixed nitrogen to cycle within the coral holobiont. The most prominent bacterial groups were Proteobacteria (68\%), Firmicutes (10\%), Cyanobacteria (7\%) and Actinobacteria (6\%). Functionally, the bacterial community was primarily heterotrophic and included a number of pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds, the most abundant being the homogentisate pathway. The most abundant phage family was the {ssDNA} Microphage and most of the eukaryotic viruses were most closely related to those known to infect aquatic organisms. This study provides a metabolic and taxonomic snapshot of microbes associated with the reef-building coral Porites astreoides and presents a basis for understanding how coral–microbial interactions structure the holobiont and coral reefs.},

However, there are rising concerns about the ability of aspen to persist in portions of its range, based on bioclimatic modeling, physiological thresholds and mortality surveys. Our ability to predict and mitigate aspen decline will depend on our understanding of the factors influencing aspen establishment and persistence. Genetic techniques are providing important insights about reproductive strategies, evolutionary and demographic histories, and adaptive capacity in western aspen, often with important and novel management implications. A suite of new genetic tools is also becoming available as a result of innovations in genomic sequencing technology, along with the availability of an annotated reference genome for Populus species. Here we present a synthesis of how these genetic tools have been, and could be, used to answer questions directly relevant to aspen ecology and management. We also present a brief description of the molecular tools themselves. Our goal is to provide an informational resource to forest managers about the utility of traditional and emerging genetic technologies, with specific relevance to aspen ecology and management.},

Multilocus sequence typing ({MLST)}, semiautomated repetitive sequence-based {PCR} (rep-{PCR)}, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ({PFGE)} were performed on a selection of 31 A. baumannii isolates collected over the 10-year period to determine their relationships to one another. {MLST} also allowed us to put this information in a global context. The presence or absence of {blaOXA-23} was also established. The presence of {blaOXA-23} closely correlated with carbapenem resistance in our collection. Sequence type 92 ({ST92)} was the dominant sequence type and was present in the hospital for 9 years. There was also evidence of the spread of {ST69}, {ST73}, and {ST125} (novel) within the hospital, but this was not sustained over long periods. There were only single examples of the novel sequence types {ST126} and {ST127.} The different typing methods clustered the isolates similarly; however, {PFGE} and rep-{PCR} were more discriminatory than {MLST.} Worldwide, {ST92} and the associated clonal complex 92 represent the most sampled and widespread sequence type(s) and are also known as European clone 2 and worldwide clonal lineage 2. Antibiotic susceptibility within {ST92} is variable, suggesting a role for mechanisms other than antibiotic resistance in its success.},

Health status and field both had significant effects on fungal community structures in roots, whereas only field had significant effects on communities in rhizosphere and bulk soils. Indicator species analysis across the three fields identified a number of {OTUs} that were more abundant in healthy roots. Pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum were abundant in diseased roots in some fields. Patterns of disease and causal agents of root rot were different among the three fields, which were also reflected in fungal communities.

Based on the commonly used mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (the standard {DNA} barcode for animal species), 14 probes were designed and synthesized for 14 species shared by two national nature reserves in Beijing and Hebei, China. Probes ranged in length from 18 to 27 bp and were designed as mismatch probes to guarantee that there were at least three base differences between the probe and nontarget sequences. The results on the chip could be detected by the naked eye without needing special equipment. No cross-hybridizations were detected although we tested all probes on the 14 target and 24 nontarget Noctuoidea species. The neighbour-joining tree of the 38 species based on {COI} sequences gave 38 highly supported independent groups. Both {DNA} barcoding and thin-film biosensor chips, based on the {COI} gene, are able to accurately identify and discriminate the 14 targeted moth species in this study. Because of its speed, high accuracy and low cost, the thin-film biosensor chip is a very practical means of species identification. Now, a more comprehensive chip will be developed for the identification of additional Noctuoidea moths for pest control and ecological protection.},

	abstract = {Background
Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR).} Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as {BLAST} to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the {BLAST} program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as {BLAST} is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range.

Results
We present a new software tool called Primer-{BLAST} to alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers. This tool combines {BLAST} with a global alignment algorithm to ensure a full primer-target alignment and is sensitive enough to detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches to primers. Primer-{BLAST} allows users to design new target-specific primers in one step as well as to check the specificity of pre-existing primers. Primer-{BLAST} also supports placing primers based on exon/intron locations and excluding single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} sites in primers.

Conclusions
We describe a robust and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool that designs target-specific {PCR} primers.

	abstract = {This review is directed at understanding how neuronal death occurs in two distinct insults, global ischemia and focal ischemia. These are the two principal rodent models for human disease. Cell death occurs by a necrotic pathway characterized by either ischemic/homogenizing cell change or edematous cell change. Death also occurs via an apoptotic-like pathway that is characterized, minimally, by {DNA} laddering and a dependence on caspase activity and, optimally, by those properties, additional characteristic protein and phospholipid changes, and morphological attributes of apotosis. Death may also occur by autophagocytosis. The cell death process has four major stages. The first, the induction stage, includes several changes initiated by ischemia and reperfusion that are very likely to play major roles in cell death. These include inhibition (and subsequent reactivation) of electron transport, decreased {ATP}, decreased {pH}, increased cell Ca2+, release of glutamate, increased arachidonic acid, and also gene activation leading to cytokine synthesis, synthesis of enzymes involved in free radical production, and accumulation of leukocytes. These changes lead to the activation of five damaging events, termed perpetrators. These are the damaging actions of free radicals and their product peroxynitrite, the actions of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain, the activity of phospholipases, the activity of poly-{ADPribose} polymerase ({PARP)}, and the activation of the apoptotic pathway. The second stage of cell death involves the long-term changes in macromolecules or key metabolites that are caused by the perpetrators. The third stage of cell death involves long-term damaging effects of these macromolecular and metabolite changes, and of some of the induction processes, on critical cell functions and structures that lead to the defined end stages of cell damage. These targeted functions and structures include the plasmalemma, the mitochondria, the cytoskeleton, protein synthesis, and kinase activities. The fourth stage is the progression to the morphological and biochemical end stages of cell death. Of these four stages, the last two are the least well understood. Quite little is known of how the perpetrators affect the structures and functions and whether and how each of these changes contribute to cell death. According to this description, the key step in ischemic cell death is adequate activation of the perpetrators, and thus a major unifying thread of the review is a consideration of how the changes occurring during and after ischemia, including gene activation and synthesis of new proteins, conspire to produce damaging levels of free radicals and peroxynitrite, to activate calpain and other Ca2+-driven processes that are damaging, and to initiate the apoptotic process. Although it is not fully established for all cases, the major driving force for the necrotic cell death process, and very possibly the other processes, appears to be the generation of free radicals and peroxynitrite. Effects of a large number of damaging changes can be explained on the basis of their ability to generate free radicals in early or late stages of damage. Several important issues are defined for future study. These include determining the triggers for apoptosis and autophagocytosis and establishing greater confidence in most of the cellular changes that are hypothesized to be involved in cell death. A very important outstanding issue is identifying the critical functional and structural changes caused by the perpetrators of cell death. These changes are responsible for cell death, and their identity and mechanisms of action are almost completely unknown.},

However, whilst range expansions at high elevations and latitudes have been widely documented, there has been surprisingly little evidence for contractions at warm margins. We show that lower elevational limits for 16 butterfly species in central Spain have risen on average by 212 m (± {SE} 60) in 30 years, accompanying a 1.3 {°C} rise (equivalent to c. 225 m) in mean annual temperature. These elevational shifts signify an average reduction in habitable area by one-third, with losses of 50–80\% projected for the coming century, given maintenance of the species thermal associations. The results suggest that many species have already suffered climate-mediated habitat losses that may threaten their long-term chances of survival.},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {We studied regional variation in growth-limiting factors and responses to climatic variability in subalpine forests by analyzing growth patterns for 28 tree-ring growth chronologies from subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) stands in the Cascade and Olympic Mountains (Washington and Oregon, {U.S.A.).} Factor analysis identified four distinct time series of common growth patterns; the dominant growth pattern at any site varied with annual precipitation and temperature (elevation). Throughout much of the region, growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation and spring snowpack depth, indicating that growth is limited primarily by short growing seasons. On the driest and warmest sites, growth is negatively correlated with previous summer temperature, suggesting that low summer soil moisture limits growth. Growth patterns in two regions were sensitive to climatic variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, apparently responding to low-frequency variation in spring snowpack and summer soil moisture (one negatively, one positively). This regional-scale analysis shows that subalpine fir growth in the Cascades and Olympics is limited by different climatic factors in different subregional climates. Climate–growth relationships are similar to those for a co-occurring species, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière), suggesting broad biogeographic patterns of response to climatic variability and change by subalpine forest ecosystems in the Pacific {Northwest.Les} auteurs ont étudié la variation régionale des facteurs qui limitent la croissance et les réponses à la variabilité climatique de forêts subalpines en analysant les patrons de croissance de 28 séries dendrochronologiques établies à partir de peuplements de sapin subalpin (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) situés dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic (Washington et Oregon, États-Unis). Une analyse factorielle a identifié quatre séries temporelles distinctes de patrons de croissance communs; le patron de croissance dominant dans tous les sites varie en fonction de la précipitation annuelle et de la température (altitude). Dans la plus grande partie de la région, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la précipitation hivernale et à la hauteur de neige accumulée au printemps, ce qui indique que la croissance est surtout limitée par de courtes saisons de croissance. Dans les sites les plus chauds et les plus secs, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la température de l'été précédent, indiquant qu'une faible quantité d'humidité dans le sol en été limite la croissance. Les patrons de croissance de deux régions sont sensibles aux variations climatiques associées à {l'Oscillation} Décennale du Pacifique, en répondant apparemment à la variation de basse fréquence de la couverture nivale au printemps et de l'humidité du sol en été (négativement dans un cas et positivement dans l'autre). Cette analyse à l'échelle régionale montre que la croissance du sapin subalpin dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic est limitée par des facteurs climatiques différents dans des climats sous-régionaux différents. Les relations entre la croissance et le climat sont similaires à celles d'une espèce cooccurrente, la pruche des montagnes (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière), ce qui suggère l'existence de larges patrons biogéographiques de réponse à la variabilité et au changement climatique dans les écosystèmes forestiers subalpins du Nord-Ouest du Pacifique.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

	abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic nosocomial pathogen. This microorganism survives in hospital environments despite unfavorable conditions such as desiccation, nutrient starvation and antimicrobial treatments. It is hypothesized that its ability to persist in these environments, as well as its virulence, is a result of its capacity to form biofilms. A. baumannii forms biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as polystyrene and glass as well as biotic surfaces such as epithelial cells and fungal filaments. Pili assembly and production of the Bap surface-adhesion protein play a role in biofilm initiation and maturation after initial attachment to abiotic surfaces. Furthermore, the adhesion and biofilm phenotypes of some clinical isolates seem to be related to the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. The regulation of the formation and development of these biofilms is as diverse as the surfaces on which this bacterium persists and as the cellular components that participate in this programmed multistep process. The regulatory processes associated with biofilm formation include sensing of bacterial cell density, the presence of different nutrients and the concentration of free cations available to bacterial cells. Some of these extracellular signals may be sensed by two-component regulatory systems such as {BfmRS.} This transcriptional regulatory system activates the expression of the usher-chaperone assembly system responsible for the production of pili, needed for cell attachment and biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces. However, such a system is not required for biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces when cells are cultured in chemically defined media. Interestingly, the {BfmRS} system also controls cell morphology under particular culture conditions.},

Here, we use a candidate gene-based approach to search for genetic associations between 384 single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} markers from 117 candidate genes and 21 cold-hardiness related traits. A general linear model approach, including population structure estimates as covariates, was implemented for each marker–trait pair. We discovered 30 highly significant genetic associations [false discovery rate ({FDR)} Q {\textless} 0.10] across 12 candidate genes and 10 of the 21 traits. We also detected a set of 7 markers that had elevated levels of differentiation between sampling sites situated across the Cascade crest in northeastern Washington. Marker effects were small (r2 {\textless} 0.05) and within the range of those published previously for forest trees. The derived {SNP} allele, as measured by a comparison to a recently diverged sister species, typically affected the phenotype in a way consistent with cold hardiness. The majority of markers were characterized as having largely nonadditive modes of gene action, especially underdominance in the case of cold-tolerance related phenotypes. We place these results in the context of trade-offs between the abilities to grow longer and to avoid fall cold damage, as well as putative epigenetic effects. These associations provide insight into the genetic components of complex traits in coastal Douglas fir, as well as highlight the need for landscape genetic approaches to the detection of adaptive genetic diversity.},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {We studied regional variation in growth-limiting factors and responses to climatic variability in subalpine forests by analyzing growth patterns for 28 tree-ring growth chronologies from subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) stands in the Cascade and Olympic Mountains (Washington and Oregon, {U.S.A.).} Factor analysis identified four distinct time series of common growth patterns; the dominant growth pattern at any site varied with annual precipitation and temperature (elevation). Throughout much of the region, growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation and spring snowpack depth, indicating that growth is limited primarily by short growing seasons. On the driest and warmest sites, growth is negatively correlated with previous summer temperature, suggesting that low summer soil moisture limits growth. Growth patterns in two regions were sensitive to climatic variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, apparently responding to low-frequency variation in spring snowpack and summer soil moisture (one negatively, one positively). This regional-scale analysis shows that subalpine fir growth in the Cascades and Olympics is limited by different climatic factors in different subregional climates. Climate–growth relationships are similar to those for a co-occurring species, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière), suggesting broad biogeographic patterns of response to climatic variability and change by subalpine forest ecosystems in the Pacific {Northwest.Les} auteurs ont étudié la variation régionale des facteurs qui limitent la croissance et les réponses à la variabilité climatique de forêts subalpines en analysant les patrons de croissance de 28 séries dendrochronologiques établies à partir de peuplements de sapin subalpin (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) situés dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic (Washington et Oregon, États-Unis). Une analyse factorielle a identifié quatre séries temporelles distinctes de patrons de croissance communs; le patron de croissance dominant dans tous les sites varie en fonction de la précipitation annuelle et de la température (altitude). Dans la plus grande partie de la région, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la précipitation hivernale et à la hauteur de neige accumulée au printemps, ce qui indique que la croissance est surtout limitée par de courtes saisons de croissance. Dans les sites les plus chauds et les plus secs, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la température de l'été précédent, indiquant qu'une faible quantité d'humidité dans le sol en été limite la croissance. Les patrons de croissance de deux régions sont sensibles aux variations climatiques associées à {l'Oscillation} Décennale du Pacifique, en répondant apparemment à la variation de basse fréquence de la couverture nivale au printemps et de l'humidité du sol en été (négativement dans un cas et positivement dans l'autre). Cette analyse à l'échelle régionale montre que la croissance du sapin subalpin dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic est limitée par des facteurs climatiques différents dans des climats sous-régionaux différents. Les relations entre la croissance et le climat sont similaires à celles d'une espèce cooccurrente, la pruche des montagnes (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière), ce qui suggère l'existence de larges patrons biogéographiques de réponse à la variabilité et au changement climatique dans les écosystèmes forestiers subalpins du Nord-Ouest du Pacifique.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

	abstract = {{DNA} sequencing of ancient permafrost samples can be used to reconstruct past plant, animal and bacterial communities. In this study, we assess the small-scale reproducibility of taxonomic composition obtained from sequencing four molecular markers (mitochondrial {12S} ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA)}, prokaryote {16S} {rDNA}, mitochondrial cox1 and chloroplast {trnL} intron) from two soil cores sampled 10 cm apart. In addition, sequenced control reactions were used to produce a contaminant library that was used to filter similar sequences from sample libraries. Contaminant filtering resulted in the removal of 1\% of reads or 0.3\% of operational taxonomic units. We found similar richness, overlap, abundance and taxonomic diversity from the {12S}, {16S} and {trnL} markers from each soil core. Jaccard dissimilarity across the two soil cores was highest for metazoan taxa detected by the {12S} and cox1 markers. Taxonomic community distances were similar for each marker across the two soil cores when the chi-squared metric was used; however, the {12S} and cox1 markers did not cluster well when the Goodall similarity metric was used. A comparison of plant macrofossil vs. read abundance corroborates previous work that suggests eastern Beringia was dominated by grasses and forbs during cold stages of the Pleistocene, a habitat that is restricted to isolated sites in the present-day Yukon.},

	abstract = {Coral bleaching, i.e., loss of most of the symbiotic zooxanthellae normally found within coral tissue, has occurred with increasing frequency on coral reefs throughout the world in the last 20 years, mostly during periods of El Nino Southern Oscillation ({ENSO).} Experiments and observations indicate that coral bleaching results primarily from elevated seawater temperatures under high light conditions, which increases rates of biochemical reactions associated with zooxanthellar photosynthesis, producing toxic forms of oxygen that interfere with cellular processes. Published projections of a baseline of increasing ocean temperature resulting from global warming have suggested that annual temperature maxima within 30 years may be at levels that will cause frequent coral bleaching and widespread mortality leading to decline of corals as dominant organisms on reefs. However, these projections have not considered the high variability in bleaching response that occurs among corals both within and among species. There is information that corals and their symbionts may be capable of acclimatization and selective adaptation to elevated temperatures that have already resulted in bleaching resistant coral populations, both locally and regionally, in various areas of the world. There are possible mechanisms that might provide resistance and protection to increased temperature and light. These include inducible heat shock proteins that act in refolding denatured cellular and structural proteins, production of oxidative enzymes that inactivate harmful oxygen radicals, fluorescent coral pigments that both reflect and dissipate light energy, and phenotypic adaptations of zooxanthellae and adaptive shifts in their populations at higher temperatures. Such mechanisms, when considered in conjunction with experimental and observational evidence for coral recovery in areas that have undergone coral bleaching, suggest an as yet undefined capacity in corals and zooxanthellae to adapt to conditions that have induced coral bleaching. Clearly, there are limits to acclimatory processes that can counter coral bleaching resulting from elevated sea temperatures, but scientific models will not accurately predict the fate of reef corals until we have a better understanding of coral-algal acclimatization/adaptation potential. Research is particularly needed with respect to the molecular and physiological mechanisms that promote thermal tolerance in corals and zooxanthellae and identification of genetic characteristics responsible for the variety of responses that occur in a coral bleaching event. Only then will we have some idea of the nature of likely responses, the timescales involved and the role of ‘experience’ in modifying bleaching impact.},

	abstract = {Although the applicability of small subunit ribosomal {RNA} ({16S} {rRNA)} sequences for bacterial classification is now well accepted, the general use of these molecules has been hindered by the technical difficulty of obtaining their sequences. A protocol is described for rapidly generating large blocks of {16S} {rRNA} sequence data without isolation of the {16S} {rRNA} or cloning of its gene. The {16S} {rRNA} in bulk cellular {RNA} preparations is selectively targeted for dideoxynucleotide-terminated sequencing by using reverse transcriptase and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to universally conserved {16S} {rRNA} sequences. Three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to the three major {16S} {rRNA} structural domains, routinely yield 800-1000 nucleotides of {16S} {rRNA} sequence. The method is evaluated with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in the template {RNA}, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of several {16S} {rRNAs} whose gene sequences are known. The relative simplicity of this approach should facilitate a rapid expansion of the {16S} {rRNA} sequence collection available for phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {Although the number of studies investigating mycorrhizal associations in orchids has increased in recent years, the fungal communities associating with orchids and how they differ between species and sites remain unclear. Recent research has indicated that individual orchid plants may associate with several fungi concurrently, implying that to study mycorrhizal associations in orchids the fungal community should be assessed rather than the presence of individual dominant fungal species or strains. High-throughput sequencing methods, such as 454 pyrosequencing, are increasingly used as the primary tool for such analyses. However, many studies combine universal primers from previous phylogenetic or ecological studies to generate amplicons suitable for 454 pyrosequencing without first critically evaluating their performance, potentially resulting in biased fungal community descriptions. Here, following in silico primer analysis we evaluated the performance of different combinations of existing {PCR} primers to characterize orchid mycorrhizal communities using 454 pyrosequencing by analysis of both an artificially assembled community of mycorrhizal fungi isolated from diverse orchid species and root samples from three different orchid species (Anacamptis morio, Ophrys tenthredinifera and Serapias lingua). Our results indicate that primer pairs {ITS3/ITS4OF} and {ITS86F/ITS4}, targeting the internal transcribed spacer-2 ({ITS-2)} region, outperformed other tested primer pairs in terms of number of reads, number of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs)} recovered from the artificial community, and number of different orchid mycorrhizal-associating families detected in the orchid samples. Additionally, we show the complementary specificity of both primer pairs, making them highly suitable for tandem use when studying the diversity of orchid mycorrhizal {communities.This} article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Background. We investigated an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infection among {US} service members injured in Iraq.
Methods. The investigation was conducted in Iraq and Kuwait, in the 2 military hospitals where the majority of injured service members were initially treated. After initially characterizing the outbreak, we evaluated 3 potential sources of infection for the period March 2003 to December 2004. The evaluation included screening samples that were obtained from the skin of patients for the presence of colonization and assessing the soil and health care environments for the presence of A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms. Isolates obtained from samples from patients in {US} Military treatment facilities, as well as environmental isolates, were genotypically characterized and compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Results. A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms were present on the skin in only 1 (0.6\%) of 160 patients who were screened and in 1 (2\%) of 49 soil samples. A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex isolates were recovered from treatment areas in 7 of the 7 field hospitals sampled. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we identified 5 cluster groups in which isolates from patients were related to environmental isolates. One cluster included hospitalized patients who had not been deployed to Iraq. Among the clinical isolates, only imipenem, polymyxin B, and colistin demonstrated reliable in vitro antimicrobial activity. Generally, the environmental isolates were more drug susceptible than were the clinical isolates.
Conclusions. Our findings suggest that environmental contamination of field hospitals and infection transmission within health care facilities played a major role in this outbreak. On the basis of these findings, maintaining infection control throughout the military health care system is essential. Novel strategies may be required to prevent the transmission of pathogens in combat field hospitals.},

	abstract = {Results of diversity and community ecology studies strongly depend on sampling depth. Completely surveyed communities follow log-normal distribution, whereas power law functions best describe incompletely censused communities. It is arguable whether the statistics behind those theories can be applied to voluminous next generation sequencing data in microbiology by treating individual {DNA} sequences as counts of molecular taxonomic units ({MOTUs).} This study addresses the suitability of species abundance models in three groups of plant-associated fungal communities – phyllosphere, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We tested the impact of differential treatment of molecular singletons on observed and estimated species richness and species abundance distribution models. The arbuscular mycorrhizal community of 48 {MOTUs} was exhaustively sampled and followed log-normal distribution. The ectomycorrhizal (153 {MOTUs)} and phyllosphere (327 {MOTUs)} communities significantly differed from log-normal distribution. The fungal phyllosphere community in particular was clearly undersampled. This undersampling bias resulted in strong sensitivity to the exclusion of molecular singletons and other rare {MOTUs} that may represent technical artefacts. The analysis of abundant (core) and rare (satellite) {MOTUs} clearly identified two species abundance distributions in the phyllosphere data – a log-normal model for the core group and a log-series model for the satellite group. The prominent log-series distribution of satellite phyllosphere fungi highlighted the ecological significance of an infrequent fungal component in the phyllosphere community.},

	abstract = {Outbreaks of hospital infections caused by multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains are of increasing concern worldwide. Although it has been reported that particular outbreak strains are geographically widespread, little is known about the diversity and phylogenetic relatedness of A. baumannii clonal groups. Sequencing of internal portions of seven housekeeping genes (total 2,976 nt) was performed in 154 A. baumannii strains covering the breadth of known diversity and including representatives of previously recognized international clones, and in 19 representatives of other Acinetobacter species. Restricted amounts of diversity and a star-like phylogeny reveal that A. baumannii is a genetically compact species that suffered a severe bottleneck in the recent past, possibly linked to a restricted ecological niche. A. baumannii is neatly demarcated from its closest relative (genomic species {13TU)} and other Acinetobacter species. Multilocus sequence typing analysis demonstrated that the previously recognized international clones I to {III} correspond to three clonal complexes, each made of a central, predominant genotype and few single locus variants, a hallmark of recent clonal expansion. Whereas antimicrobial resistance was almost universal among isolates of these and a novel international clone ({ST15)}, isolates of the other genotypes were mostly susceptible. This dichotomy indicates that antimicrobial resistance is a major selective advantage that drives the ongoing rapid clonal expansion of these highly problematic agents of nosocomial infections.},

However, evidence that viruses confer benefits to their hosts is growing and their role as mutualists is emerging.

	abstract = {* • Soil fungi play a major role in ecological and biogeochemical processes in forests. Little is known, however, about the structure and richness of different fungal communities and the distribution of functional ecological groups (pathogens, saprobes and symbionts). * • Here, we assessed the fungal diversity in six different forest soils using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 ({ITS-1).} No less than 166 350 {ITS} reads were obtained from all samples. In each forest soil sample (4 g), approximately 30 000 reads were recovered, corresponding to around 1000 molecular operational taxonomic units. * • Most operational taxonomic units (81\%) belonged to the Dikarya subkingdom (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Richness, abundance and taxonomic analyses identified the Agaricomycetes as the dominant fungal class. The {ITS-1} sequences (73\%) analysed corresponded to only 26 taxa. The most abundant operational taxonomic units showed the highest sequence similarity to Ceratobasidium sp., Cryptococcus podzolicus, Lactarius sp. and Scleroderma sp. * • This study validates the effectiveness of high-throughput 454 sequencing technology for the survey of soil fungal diversity. The large proportion of unidentified sequences, however, calls for curated sequence databases. The use of pyrosequencing on soil samples will accelerate the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fungal communities in forest ecosystems.},

Due to the poor knowledge about the applicability and performance of these software tools, choosing a befitting assembler becomes a tough task. Here, we provide the information of adaptivity for each program, then above all, compare the performance of eight distinct tools against eight groups of simulated datasets from Solexa sequencing platform. Considering the computational time, maximum random access memory ({RAM)} occupancy, assembly accuracy and integrity, our study indicate that string-based assemblers, overlap-layout-consensus ({OLC)} assemblers are well-suited for very short reads and longer reads of small genomes respectively. For large datasets of more than hundred millions of short reads, De Bruijn graph-based assemblers would be more appropriate. In terms of software implementation, string-based assemblers are superior to graph-based ones, of which {SOAPdenovo} is complex for the creation of configuration file. Our comparison study will assist researchers in selecting a well-suited assembler and offer essential information for the improvement of existing assemblers or the developing of novel assemblers.},

	abstract = {We used an individual-based forest simulator (a gap model) to assess the potential effects of anthropogenic climatic change on conifer forests of the Pacific Northwestern United States. Steady-state simulations suggested that forest zones could be shifted on the order of 500–1000 m in elevation, which could lead to the local extirpation of some high-altitude species. For low-elevation sites, species which currently are more abundant hundreds of kilometers to the south would be favored under greenhouse scenarios. Simulations of transient responses suggested that forest stands could show complex responses depending on initial species composition, stand age and canopy development, and the magnitude and duration of climatic warming. Assumptions about species response to temperature, which are crucial to the model's behaviors, were evaluated using data on species temperature limits inferred from regional distributions. The high level of within-species variability in these data, and other confounding factors influencing species distributions, argue against over-interpreting simulations. We suggest how we might resolve critical uncertainties with further research.},

In this study, genome and other large sequence databases were used to identify over 225 potential genetic markers for phylogenetic analyses. Here, we present a genus-wide phylogeny for 82 Phytophthora species using seven of the most informative loci (approximately 8700 nucleotide sites). Our results support the division of the genus into 10 well-supported clades. The relationships among these clades were rigorously evaluated using a number of phylogenetic methods. This is the most comprehensive study of Phytophthora relationships to date, and many newly discovered species have been included. A more resolved phylogeny of Phytophthora species will allow for better interpretations of the overall evolutionary history of the genus.},

	abstract = {The {DNA} barcoding technology uses a standard region of {DNA} sequence for species identification and discovery. At present, {“DNA} barcode” actually refers to {DNA} sequences, which are not amenable to information storage, recognition, and retrieval. Our aim is to identify the best symbology that can represent {DNA} barcode sequences in practical applications. A comprehensive set of sequences for five {DNA} barcode markers {ITS2}, {rbcL}, {matK}, {psbA-trnH}, and {CO1} was used as the test data. Fifty-three different types of one-dimensional and ten two-dimensional barcode symbologies were compared based on different criteria, such as coding capacity, compression efficiency, and error detection ability. The quick response ({QR)} code was found to have the largest coding capacity and relatively high compression ratio. To facilitate the further usage of {QR} code-based {DNA} barcodes, a web server was developed and is accessible at http://qrfordna.dnsalias.org. The web server allows users to retrieve the {QR} code for a species of interests, convert a {DNA} sequence to and from a {QR} code, and perform species identification based on local and global sequence similarities. In summary, the first comprehensive evaluation of various barcode symbologies has been carried out. The {QR} code has been found to be the most appropriate symbology for {DNA} barcode sequences. A web server has also been constructed to allow biologists to utilize {QR} codes in practical {DNA} barcoding applications.},

To evaluate structural and functional changes in coral microbial communities, Porites compressa was exposed to four stressors: increased temperature, elevated nutrients, dissolved organic carbon loading and reduced {pH.} Microbial metagenomic samples were collected and pyrosequenced. Functional gene analysis demonstrated that stressors increased the abundance of microbial genes involved in virulence, stress resistance, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism, motility and chemotaxis, fatty acid and lipid utilization, and secondary metabolism. Relative changes in taxonomy also demonstrated that coral-associated microbiota (Archaea, Bacteria, protists) shifted from a healthy-associated coral community (e.g. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and the zooxanthellae Symbiodinium) to a community (e.g. Bacteriodetes, Fusobacteria and Fungi) of microbes often found on diseased corals. Additionally, low-abundance Vibrio spp. were found to significantly alter microbiome metabolism, suggesting that the contribution of a just a few members of a community can profoundly shift the health status of the coral holobiont.},

We compared the recent de novo assemblies using the short oligonucleotide analysis package ({SOAP)}, generated from the genomes of a Han Chinese individual and a Yoruban individual, to experimentally validated genomic features. We found that de novo assemblies were 16.2\% shorter than the reference genome and that 420.2 megabase pairs of common repeats and 99.1\% of validated duplicated sequences were missing from the genome. Consequently, over 2,377 coding exons were completely missing.

Methods {MICs} were determined by broth microdilution and Etest. The presence of carbapenemase-encoding genes was investigated by {PCR.} Molecular epidemiology was performed by repetitive sequence-based {PCR} (rep-{PCR;} {DiversiLab)}, sequence-type multiplex {PCR} and {PFGE.}
Results Imipenem non-susceptibility was associated with {ISAba1} upstream of the intrinsic {blaOXA-51-like} or the acquired carbapenemase {blaOXA-23-like}, {blaOXA-40-like} or {blaOXA-58-like.} Isolates were grouped into eight distinct clusters including European clones I, {II} and {III.} European clone {II} was the largest (246 isolates) and most widespread group ({USA}, pan-Europe, Israel, Asia, Australia and South Africa).
Conclusions The global dissemination of eight carbapenem-resistant lineages illustrates the success this organism has had in epidemic spread. The acquired {OXA} enzymes are widely distributed but are not the sole carbapenem resistance determinant in A. baumannii.},

	abstract = {Various combinations of antibiotics are reported to show synergy in treating nosocomial infections with multidrug-resistant ({MDR)} Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii). Here, we studied hospital-acquired outbreak strains of {MDR} A. baumannii to evaluate optimal combinations of antibiotics. One hundred and twenty-one strains were grouped into one major and one minor clonal group based on repetitive {PCR} amplification. Twenty representative strains were tested for antibiotic synergy using Etest®. Five strains were further analyzed by analytical isoelectric focusing and {PCR} to identify β-lactamase genes or other antibiotic resistance determinants. Our investigation showed that the outbreak strains of {MDR} A. baumannii belonged to two dominant clones. A combination of colistin and doxycycline showed the best result, being additive or synergistic against 70\% of tested strains. Antibiotic additivity was observed more frequently than synergy. Strains possessing the same clonality did not necessarily demonstrate the same response to antibiotic combinations in vitro. We conclude that the effect of antibiotic combinations on our outbreak strains of {MDR} A. baumannii seemed strain-specific. The bacterial response to antibiotic combinations is probably a result of complex interactions between multiple concomitant antibiotic resistance determinants in each strain.},

These {VLPs} had similar morphologies to known prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses in other systems. Icosahedral {VLPs} were observed most frequently, however, filamentous {VLPs} ({FVLPs)} and phage were also noted. There were no clear differences in {VLP} size, morphology or location within the tissues with respect to sample date, coral health status or site. The most common {VLP} morphotype exhibited icosahedral symmetry, 120–150 nm in diameter, with an electron-dense core and an electronlucent membrane. Larger {VLPs} of similar morphology were also common. {VLPs} occurred as single entities, in groups, or in dense clusters, either as free particles within coral tissues, or within membrane-bound vacuoles. {VLPs} were commonly observed within the perinuclear region, with mitochondria, golgi apparatus and crescent-shaped particles frequently observed within close proximity. The host(s) of these observed {VLPs} was not clear; however, the different sizes and morphologies of {VLPs} observed within A. muricata tissues suggest that viruses are infecting either the coral animal, zooxanthellae, intracellular bacteria and/or other coral-associated microbiota, or that the one host is susceptible to infection from more than one type of virus. These results add to the limited but emerging body of evidence that viruses represent another potentially important component of the coral holobiont.},

Most of the isolates were non-sporulating and therefore difficult to identify exclusively based on morphological characters. Eighteen isolates that were morphologically distinct were selected for identification by sequencing the {ITS} region. For culture-independent analysis, the {DNA} was isolated from the surface-sterilized leaves of R. tomentosum and the {ITS} region was amplified using fungal specific primers {ITS1F} and {ITS4}, cloned, and 11 clones were randomly selected and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis was performed with {MEGA4} on a total of 49 sequences, including 18 endophytic isolates and 11 unculturables obtained in this study, and 20 sequences from Genbank, which were distributed in four clusters. The culturable and unculturable endophytes formed separate clades and were clearly distinguishable with no overlap within the groups. Endophytic fungi are a well-recognized source of bioactive compounds and therefore antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the isolates of R. tomentosum were studied. All isolates were grown in two different media, enriched ({MEB)} and depleted ({DM)}, and screened for antibacterial and antioxidant activities. As a result, 10\% produced antibacterials and 14\% antioxidants, in total 24\% of the isolates had biological activity. Antioxidant broth of {TRT59} was partially purified using {HPLC.} The majority of antibacterial compounds were produced in {DM} media and antioxidants in {MEB} media. Therefore, it is advisable to test various media for production of antibacterials and antioxidants.},

Pyrosequencing resulted in 16 965 reads, detecting all species in the template {DNA} mixture. Reducing the {ITS1} sequence identity threshold resulted in a decrease in numbers of unmatched reads but a concomitant increase in the numbers of false {MOTUs.} The total error rate was 0·63\% and comprised mainly mismatches (0·25\%) Conclusions Pyrosequencing of {ITS1} region is an efficient and accurate technique for the detection and identification of Phytophthora spp. in environmental samples. However, the risk of allocating false {MOTUs}, even when demonstrated to be low, may require additional validation with alternative detection methods. Significance and Impact of the Study Phytophthora spp. are considered among the most destructive groups of invasive plant pathogens, affecting thousands of cultivated and wild plants worldwide. Simultaneous early detection of Phytophthora complexes in environmental samples offers an unique opportunity for the interception of known and unknown species along pathways of introduction, along with the identification of these organisms in invaded environments.},

	volume = {182},
	issn = {0021-9193},
	abstract = {The alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase ({ALDC)} gene, {aldB}, is the penultimate gene of the leu-ilv-ald operon, which encodes the three branched-chain amino acid ({BCAA)} biosynthesis genes in Lactococcus lactis. Its product plays a dual role in the cell: (i) it catalyzes the second step of the acetoin pathway, and (ii) it controls the pool of alpha-acetolactate during leucine and valine synthesis. It can be transcribed from the two promoters present upstream of the leu and ilv genes (P1 and P2) or independently under the control of its own promoter (P3). In this paper we show that the production of {ALDC} is limited by two mechanisms. First, the strength of P3 decreases greatly during starvation for {BCAAs} and under other conditions that generally provoke the stringent response. Second, although {aldB} is actively transcribed from P1 and P2 during {BCAA} starvation, {ALDC} is not significantly produced from these transcripts. The {aldB} ribosome binding site ({RBS)} appears to be entrapped in a stem-loop, which is itself part of a more complex {RNA} folding structure. The function of the structure was studied by mutagenesis, using translational fusions with luciferase genes to assess its activity. The presence of the single stem-loop entrapping the {aldB} {RBS} was responsible for a 100-fold decrease in the level of {aldB} translation. The presence of a supplementary secondary structure upstream of the stem-loop led to an additional fivefold decrease of {aldB} translation. Finally, the translation of the {ilvA} gene terminating in the latter structure decreased the level of translation of {aldB} fivefold more, leading to the complete extinction of the reporter gene activity. Since three leucines and one valine are present among the last six amino acids of the {ilvA} product, we propose that pausing of the ribosomes during translation could modulate the folding of the messenger, as a function of {BCAA} availability. The purpose of the structure-dependent regulation could be to ensure the minimal production of {ALDC} required for the control of the acetolactate pool during {BCAA} synthesis but to avoid its overproduction, which would dissipate acetolactate. Large amounts of {ALDC}, necessary for operation of the acetoin pathway, could be produced under favorable conditions from the P3 transcripts, which do not contain the secondary structures.},

In the present study a molecular approach was developed to detect Phytophthora species in soil and water samples using novel sets of genus-specific primers designed against the internal transcribed spacer ({ITS)} regions. Two different {rDNA} primer sets were tested: one assay amplified a long product including the {ITS1}, {5.8S} and {ITS2} regions ({LP)} and the other a shorter product including the {ITS1} only ({SP).} Both assays specifically amplified products from Phytophthora species without cross-reaction with the related Pythium s. lato, however the {SP} assay proved the more sensitive and reliable. The method was validated using woodland soil and stream water from Invergowrie, Scotland. On-site use of a knapsack sprayer and in-line water filters proved more rapid and effective than centrifugation at sampling Phytophthora propagules. A total of 15 different Phytophthora phylotypes were identified which clustered within the reported {ITS-clades} 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8. The range and type of the sequences detected varied from sample to sample and up to three and five different Phytophthora phylotypes were detected within a single sample of soil or water, respectively. The most frequently detected sequences were related to members of {ITS-clade} 6 (i.e. P. gonapodyides-like). The new method proved very effective at discriminating multiple species in a given sample and can also detect as yet unknown species. The reported primers and methods will prove valuable for ecological studies, biosecurity and commercial plant, soil or water (e.g. irrigation water) testing as well as the wider metagenomic sampling of this fascinating component of microbial pathogen diversity.},

Here we compare the two {ITS} regions, {ITS-1} and {ITS-2}, of the fungal populations occurring in Tuber {melanosporum/Quercus} pubescens truffle grounds and sampled in two areas, one devoid of vegetation (“burned”, brulé in French) where T. melanosporum fruiting bodies are usually collected, and outside the brulé. {TS1F/ITS2} and {ITS3/ITS4} were used respectively for the amplification of the {ITS-1} and {ITS-2} regions. Two amplicon libraries were built, one for inside and the other for outside. A set of 15.788 reads was obtained. After the removal of low quality sequences, 3568 and 3156 sequences were obtained from inside the brulé with the {ITS-1} and {ITS-2} primers respectively. The sequences obtained from outside the brulé were 4490 with the {ITS-1} primers and 2432 with the {ITS-2} primers. Most of the sequences obtained for both {ITS} fragments could be attributed to fungal organisms.
The pair of primers, {ITS1-F/ITS2}, was more selective, producing fewer non-fungal sequences (1\% inside, 3\% outside), in addition to a higher number of sequences, than the pair {ITS3/ITS4} (6\% inside, 11\% outside). Although differences are present in the taxa percentages between {ITS-1} and {ITS-2}, both reveal that Ascomycota were the dominant fungal phylum and that their number decreased moving from inside the brulé to outside, while the number of Basidiomycota increased. Taken together, both the short {ITS-1} and {ITS-2} reads obtained by the high throughput 454 sequencing provide adequate information for taxon assignment and are suitable to correlate the dynamics of the fungal populations to specific environments.},

	abstract = {Computer models designed to simulate the dynamics of a
forest by following the fates of each individual tree in a
forest stand were created initially in the mid-1960s. The
earliest such model was built by Newnham (1964), followed
by similar developments in several Schools of Forestry in the
{US.} These early models involved using a digital computer
to dynamically change a map of the sizes and positions of
each tree in a simulated forest. Importantly, these initial
models were as complex and as detailed as their present day
descendants. With increased computing power becoming
cheap and available, applications using these models have
become increasingly frequent (Shugart and West, 1980).
Gap models simulate the changes in a small patch of
forest on the order of 0.1 ha in size. The models project
the annual growth of each individual tree on the patch
as well as the death of each tree and the regeneration of
new individual trees. Gap models are important because
of their widespread applications in assessing the effects of
environmental change on forests. The models have been
applied to develop theories about the overall functioning of
forested landscape and have also been used to reconstruct
the composition of forests of the past and under future
conditions.
Gap models are a special case of the more general
individual-based models. They have been used particularly
for forest ecosystems. Because gap models have been
applied in a very wide range of ecosystems, often the term,
gap model, is used interchangeably with other individualbased
models when applied to mixed age and multi-species
ecosystems. The models simulate landscapes as dynamically
changing mosaics with each element of the mosaic having an
interactive population of trees of different species and sizes.
Output from the models resembles field data as sampled
from a standard forest survey unit: a list of the diameters
of each tree (and its species) alive on the patch for each
year. These model data can be transformed to estimates
of biomass (and hence, net production), leaf area profiles
through the canopy, and tree ring histories for each tree.},

Friedrich applications support both early stage experimentation and late stage batch processing, since they simultaneously allow for good performance and a high degree of flexibility and customisability. These benefits are obtained in large part by basing Friedrich on the multiparadigm programming language Scala.

In this study 454 amplicon pyrosequencing of the {ITS1} region was applied to 99 phylogenetically diverse axenic single-spore cultures of fungi (Dikarya: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) to investigate levels of intragenomic variation. Three species (one Basidiomycota and two Ascomycota), in addition to a positive control species known to contain {ITS} paralogs, displayed levels of molecular variation indicative of intragenomic variation; taxon inflation due to presumed intragenomic variation was ≈9\%. Intragenomic variability in the {ITS} region appears to be widespread but relatively rare in fungi (≈3–5\% of species investigated in this study), suggesting this problem may have minor impacts on species richness estimates relative to {PCR} and/or pyrosequencing errors. Our results indicate that 454 amplicon pyrosequencing represents a powerful tool for investigating levels of {ITS} intragenomic variability across taxa, which may be valuable for better understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying concerted evolution of repetitive {DNA} regions.},

	abstract = {An accurate reconstruction of the eukaryotic tree of life is essential to identify the innovations underlying the diversity of microbial and macroscopic (e.g., plants and animals) eukaryotes. Previous work has divided eukaryotic diversity into a small number of high-level “supergroups,” many of which receive strong support in phylogenomic analyses. However, the abundance of data in phylogenomic analyses can lead to highly supported but incorrect relationships due to systematic phylogenetic error. Furthermore, the paucity of major eukaryotic lineages (19 or fewer) included in these genomic studies may exaggerate systematic error and reduce power to evaluate hypotheses. Here, we use a taxon-rich strategy to assess eukaryotic relationships. We show that analyses emphasizing broad taxonomic sampling (up to 451 taxa representing 72 major lineages) combined with a moderate number of genes yield a well-resolved eukaryotic tree of life. The consistency across analyses with varying numbers of taxa (88–451) and levels of missing data (17–69\%) supports the accuracy of the resulting topologies. The resulting stable topology emerges without the removal of rapidly evolving genes or taxa, a practice common to phylogenomic analyses. Several major groups are stable and strongly supported in these analyses (e.g., {SAR}, Rhizaria, Excavata), whereas the proposed supergroup {“Chromalveolata”} is rejected. Furthermore, extensive instability among photosynthetic lineages suggests the presence of systematic biases including endosymbiotic gene transfer from symbiont (nucleus or plastid) to host. Our analyses demonstrate that stable topologies of ancient evolutionary relationships can be achieved with broad taxonomic sampling and a moderate number of genes. Finally, taxon-rich analyses such as presented here provide a method for testing the accuracy of relationships that receive high bootstrap support ({BS)} in phylogenomic analyses and enable placement of the multitude of lineages that lack genome scale data.},

We detected no significant differences in soil fungal diversity and community structure associated with different plant cultivars. However, {DNA-based} analyses yielded lower fungal {OTU} richness as compared to {RNA-based} analyses. Clear differences in fungal community structure were also observed in relation to sampling time and the nucleic acid pool targeted ({DNA} versus {RNA).} The most abundant soil fungi, as recovered by {DNA-based} methods, did not necessary represent the most “active” fungi (as recovered via {RNA).} Interestingly, {RNA-derived} community compositions at t1 were highly similar to {DNA-derived} communities at t2, based on presence/absence measures of {OTUs.} We recovered large proportions of fungal sequences belonging to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Basidiomycota, especially at the {RNA} level, suggesting that these important and potentially beneficial fungi are not affected by the plant cultivars nor by {GM} traits (Bt toxin production). Our results suggest that even though {DNA-} and {RNA-derived} soil fungal communities can be very different at a given time, {RNA} composition may have a predictive power of fungal community development through time.},

Several reports based solely on morphological observations have postulated that there is an intimate link between endophytes and saprotrophs. This study aims to provide valuable insight as to whether some endophytic fungi manifest themselves as saprotrophs upon host decay. Ribosomal {DNA-based} sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationships from 99 fungal isolates (endophytes, mycelia sterilia, and saprotrophs) recovered from leaves and twigs of Magnolia liliifera were investigated in this study. Molecular data suggest there are fungal taxa that possibly exist as endophytes and saprotrophs. Isolates of Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Guignardia, and Phomopsis, which are common plant endophytes, have high sequence similarity and are phylogenetically related to their saprotrophic counterparts. This provides evidence to suggest that some endophytic species change their ecological strategies and adopt a saprotrophic lifestyle. The implication of these findings on fungal biodiversity and host specificity is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Clonality is a common phenomenon in plants, allowing genets to persist asexually for much longer periods of time than ramets. The relative frequency of sexual vs. asexual reproduction determines long-term dominance and persistence of clonal plants at the landscape scale. One of the most familiar and valued clonal plants in North America is aspen (Populus tremuloides). Previous researchers have suggested that aspen in xeric landscapes of the intermountain west represent genets of great chronological age, maintained via clonal expansion in the near absence of sexual reproduction. We synthesized microsatellite data from 1371 ramets in two large sampling grids in Utah. We found a surprisingly large number of distinct genets, some covering large spatial areas, but most represented by only one to a few individual ramets at a sampling scale of 50 m. In general, multi-ramet genets were spatially cohesive, although some genets appear to be fragmented remnants of much larger clones. We conclude that recent sexual reproduction in these landscapes is a stronger contributor to standing genetic variation at the population level than the accumulation of somatic mutations, and that even some of the spatially large clones may not be as ancient as previously supposed. Further, a striking majority of the largest genets in both study areas had three alleles at one or more loci, suggesting triploidy or aneuploidy. These genets tended to be spatially clustered but not closely related. Together, these findings substantially advance our understanding of clonal dynamics in western North American aspen, and set the stage for a broad range of future studies.},
