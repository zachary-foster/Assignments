>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 100
>  Starting seed = 761414532
>  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 540
>  Optimality criterion = likelihood

>    NOTE: 90 all-missing characters ignored in likelihood analyses.

>    Likelihood settings:
>      Number of substitution types = 2 (HKY85 variant)
>      Transition/transversion ratio = 2 (kappa = 3.9289403)
>      Assumed state frequencies (empirical frequencies):
>        A=0.28606  C=0.23292  G=0.26320  T=0.21782
>      These settings correspond to the HKY85 model
>      Among-site rate variation:
>        Assumed proportion of invariable sites  = none
>        Distribution of rates at variable sites = equal
>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 384
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without
>        additional iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, tolerance=1e-007
>      Vector processing enabled
>      Conditional-likelihood rescaling threshold = 1e-020
>
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: as-is
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 1300 (will be auto-increased by 100)
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-008
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>  100 bootstrap replicates completed
>  Time used = 02:36:40 (CPU time = 02:30:33.7)
