The RNA protocol uses $0.1-0.4 \\mu g$ of high quality RNA (RIN $>$ 8 for eukaryotes). \n  \\item \\textbf{Ligate adaptors:} Adaptors containing the surface-annealing oligos, PCR primers, sequencing primers, and the 6 base index are ligated to the DNA amplicons fragments. \n  \\item \\textbf{Quantification of libraries with real-time qPCR}: Optional, but recommended.\n  Primers specific to the adaptors should be used so that only cluster-forming molecules are quantified.\n  \\item \\textbf{Hybridize library:} The adaptors allow DNA molecules to be hybridized to complemetary oligos attached to the flow cell.\n  An initial PCR extension of the attached oligo is used to copy the target DNA onto the flow cell.\n  \\item \\textbf{Amplify hybridized template:} Bridge amplification is used to generate clusters of idenitcal molecules (both strands) whever a single traget molecule landed during library hybridization.\n  \\item \\textbf{Linearization:} DNA molecules attached to one of the surface oligos are removed, so only one strand is sequenced.\n  In paired-end sequencing, the removed strand is later regenerated with PCR and the roles of the strands reversed.\n  \\item \\textbf{Anneal universal sequencing primer:} The universal sequencing primer is annealed to the ligated adaptor region.\n  \\item \\textbf{Sequencing with fluorescent nucleotides:} During the sequencing of each base:\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item fluorescently labeled ddNTPs are allowed to bind. \n    \\item unbound ddNTPs are washed away\n    \\item a laser excites the remaning ddNTP\n    \\item its unique color is captured by a camera\n    \\item the fluorphore and di-dioxy terminator are removed.\n  \\end{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{Base calling:} During each seuqnecing cycle, each cluster fluoresces a color indicating the nucleotide added.\n  The computer keeps track of the coordinates of each cluster and the color pattern in monotored over time to infer the sequence.   \n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Sequencers}\n\n\\subsubsection*{MiSeq}\n\n\\textit{\n\"The MiSeq desktop sequencer allows you to access more focused applications such as targeted gene sequencing, metagenomics, small genome sequencing, targeted gene expression, amplicon sequencing, and HLA typing. \nNew MiSeq reagents enable up to 15 Gb of output with 25 M sequencing reads and 2x300 bp read lengths.\"\n}\n\n\\subsubsection*{HiSeq 2000}\n\n\\textit{\n\"The HiSeq 2000 can be used for a variety of applications. The sequencing process takes place on a flow cell with 8 channels (one channel must be used for a PhiX control DNA), each of which may contain a different sample (or many samples if multiplexing). \nIn early 2011 Illumina released v.3 kits, in which the amount of data that can be produced increased 3x.\nWith v.3 kits the HiSeq 2000 can produce $>$ 187.5 million reads or 37.5 Gb per lane.\nActual output can vary depending on cluster density, but a typical run should produce $>$ 150 million filtered reads.\"\n}\n\n\\subsubsection*{HiSeq 2500}\n\n\\textit{\n\"The HiSeq 2500 System is a powerful and efficient ultra-high-throughput sequencing system that supports the broadest range of applications and study sizes.\nUnrivaled data quality using Illumina's proven SBS chemistry has made the HiSeq 2500 the instrument of choice for all major genome centers and leading institutions throughout the world.\"\n}\n\n\\subsection{Library Preparation}\n\nMost Illumina librrary prep kits are designed for genomic DNA as the starting material. Using PCR amplicons without fragmentaion is much less common, and has not been fully evaluated by Illumina. However, Illumina does provide a borchure explaining how to sequence 16S amplicons in multiplexed samples \\cite{illumina_high-speed_2014}. This process uses a Nextera Index Kit and two low-cycle PCRs to attach the adapters for sequencing. The first PCR uses primers to amplify experiment-specific loci from genomic DNA that have 5' \"overhangs.\" These overhangs are generic (i.e. do not bind to genomic DNA) and allow for the next PCR to add the Illumina adaptor sequences. It is possible to use custom-designed primers, not bought from Illumina, to accomplish this, however if a problem occurs during the run, Illumina will not provide support.  \n\n\\section{CGRB Services}\nThe CGRB has many optional services associated with MiSeq and MiSeq 2000.\nThese services, such as library preparation can save time and lessen the probability of error, but dramatically increase the cost. \n\n<<CGRB_services_table, results='asis', include=TRUE, external=TRUE>>=\n@\n\n\\subsection{Illumina}\nThe CGRB currently offers sequencing with both the MiSeq and the HiSeq 2000. \nOther Illumina sequencers include the HiSeq 2500.\nFor both Illumina sequencers, the researcher must do the following. \nBoldfaced tasks are offered as a service by the CGRB for the additional price indicated in the adjacent parentheses. \n\n\\subsubsection*{Quantification of Library Prep}\nIt is very important to accurately quantify the concentration of DNA to maximize the amount of usable data generated.\nSince nanodrop has a detection limit ($2ng$/$\\mu L$) near the final concentration of the library prep ($10ng$/$\\mu L$), it alone is not reliable enough for quantification.\nThe Agilent Bioanlyzer is slightly more accurate ($1ng$/$\\mu L$).\nFor best quantification fluorometery ($10pg$/$\\mu L$) or, ideally, qPCR should be used. The core lab will quantify the library prep with qPCR for \\$19 per sample and with fluorometery for \\$5 per sample. \n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item Ensure the 260/280 ratio (nanodrop) of library is around 1.8\n\t\\item \\textbf{Pool samples (\\$3 per sample)}\n\t\\item \\textbf{Perform library preparation, including barcoding(?) (\\$63-\\$147 per sample). Supply 30$\\mu L$ of 10nM sample in Qiagen buffer EB (Tris-Cl 10mM, pH 8.5) supplemented with 0.1\\% Tween-20 (optional).}\n\t\\item \\textbf{Quantify final library prep(\\$5-\\$19 per sample)} \n\t\\item \\textbf{Determine size distribution of final library prep (? per sample). The Agilent Bioanalyzer is offered at CGRB for this purpose.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection*{MiSeq}\nThe MiSeq can be run in four modes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item MiSeq Standard v.3 ($\\sim$25M reads/run, $\\sim$\\$1500)\n\t\\item MiSeq Standard v.2 ($\\sim$15M reads/run, $\\sim$\\$1300)\n\t\\item MiSeq Micro ($\\sim$4M reads/run, $\\sim$\\$1000)\n\t\\item MiSeq Nano ($\\sim$1M reads/run, $\\sim$\\$800)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection*{HiSeq 2000}\n\nAlthough there are differnet configurations of the HiSeq as well, the only one with long enough reads to sequence a barcode would be 150bp paired end ($\\sim$150M filtered reads, $\\sim\\$2600$).\n\n<<CGRB_short, results='asis', include=FALSE>>=\n#data <- data[rev(order(data$Read.Length)),]\n#Find the protocol/machine combinations that have the longest reads\n#top_read_length_protocols <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, by(data, INDICES=list(data$Protocol, data$Machine), FUN=function(x) x[1,])))\n#top_read_length_protocols <- data\n#row.names(top_read_length_protocols) <- NULL\n#top_read_length_protocols <- top_read_length_protocols[,c('Company', 'Machine', 'Read.Length', 'Read.Count', 'Base.Cost', 'Cost.Per.Read')]\n#names(top_read_length_protocols) <- c('Company', 'Machine', 'Read Length', 'Read Count (M)', 'Cost Per Run', 'Cost Read (M)')\n#xtable(top_read_length_protocols[, ])\n@\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plain}\n\\bibliography{library}\n\n\n\\end{document}\n",
