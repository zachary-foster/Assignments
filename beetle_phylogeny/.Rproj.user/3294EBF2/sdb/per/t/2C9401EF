Mesquite \\cite{maddison_mesquite:_2001} and Paup \\cite{swofford_paup*._2003} were used to conduct parsimony and maximum-likelihood analysis on both sets of sequences.\n\n\\subsection*{Multiple Sequence Alignment}\nAlignment of DNA and protein sequence was done using Mafft on the \"L-INS-i\" setting for high accuracy alignments. \nDNA alignments for the \\textit{Wingless} gene sequence was obtained by mapping the DNA sequences to the protein alignment in Mesquite. \n\n\\subsection*{Tree Inference}\nParsimony analysis and bootstrapping was done with Paup using default settings, with 1000 bootstrap replicates used. \nIn the maximum-likelihood analysis, a proportion of invariant sites following a gamma distribution was assumed and the gamma shape parameter was estimated during tree search. \nThe default settings were used for the bootstrapping analysis due to computing restrictions.\nMaximum likelihood bootstrapping was done in Paup as well and 100 bootstrap replicates were used. \n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\nThe phylogeny inferred using the 18S ribosomal sequence was much more resolved than the phylogeny inferred from the \\textit{Wingless} gene sequence and roughly corresponded to specimen classification. \nThe four analysis methods used for each sequence has similar results(Figures~\\ref{fig:18s} and ~\\ref{fig:wingless}). \n\n\\subsection*{18S Phylogeny}\nThe phylogeny of 18S is well resolved and monophyletic clades mostly correspond to beetle suborders.\nIn the best maximum-likelihood tree, half of the Geadephaga species occurs within the Hydradephaga clade, possibly due to short branch lengths at the base of the clade. The maximum-likelihood bootstrap method and both parsimony analyses show Geadephaga and Hydradephaga as separate monophyletic clades.\nPolytomies in Geadephaga and Hydradephaga (Figure \\ref{fig:18s} \\subref{fig:18s_maximum_liklihood_100_bootstrap} and \\subref{fig:18s_parsimony_1000-bootstrap}) represent uncertain placement of species within the suborder. \n\n\\subsection*{\\textit{Wingless} Phylogeny}\nThe phylogeny inferred using the \\textit{Wingless} gene sequence was much less resolved than that of 18S.\nThe only monophyletic group inferred was Geadephaga in the maximum-likelihood analysis in which invariant sites were simulated.\nThe bootstrap analysis using both parsimony and maximum-likelihood techniques yielded similar, but unresolved results. \n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n \\centering\n \\subfigure[Strict consensus tree of 2 top-scoring trees using maximum-likelihood]{\n  \\includegraphics[height=9cm]{18s_maximum_liklihood}\n   \\label{fig:18s_maximum_liklihood}\n   }\n \\hspace{10pt}\n \\subfigure[Majority-rule consensus tree of 100 maximum- likelihood bootstrap replicates]{\n  \\includegraphics[height=9cm]{18s_maximum_liklihood_100_bootstrap}\n   \\label{fig:18s_maximum_liklihood_100_bootstrap}\n   }\n\n \\subfigure[Strict consensus tree of 4 top-scoring trees using parsimony.
